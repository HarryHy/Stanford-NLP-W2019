You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather dance, and never one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the picture of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> did.
It's the kind of a complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the 1970s on the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went down to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the teachers.
He did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never came to us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I must tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to tell you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see it, and we found ourselves <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew what to do.
And as a woman who wanted to be <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box on the cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed -- it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
So through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around <unk> of the water almost 60 meters, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after a year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others cannot be able to get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, looking at a <unk> that are isolated and separated by themselves, as well as human beings we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg, releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there exist in that way and will not exist in that way.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's little frequent going to actually witness a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see on the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stand too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of that, you're not going to pay attention to me.
Think about that for a moment.
And on this scenario I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome is that the chromosome joins the X chromosome to the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is sperm joins into the X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
And in my activity that will go to two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people <unk> the anatomy -- which is, human bodies and <unk> how have they considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is the one of an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes -- <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside a same body.
I've worked with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit in the male male and female feminine models.
On the general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't exist in the common human forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that became <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops on a <unk> course.
When I <unk> the baby is like a little bit like a little bit of a girl.
It's a girl, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast time, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And after doing testing they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk> chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman to do not know his structure, and I believe it will be a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life as a kid and just found that I had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th <unk> and the uterus <unk> glands, they were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at age 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what is known as <unk> is that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know very well why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> to open-heart surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
And the reason that we get to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture to the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children who are born like two people inside a same body.
The most high case is the most high year of the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> was placed in the <unk> his sex <unk>
A lot of reporters called to ask, "What are they going to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that you have to admit that nature doesn't plot a line and between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and women and women, we are who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go to science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were kind of <unk> stable categories.
And not just in sex.
It's also in terms of race -- something that happens to be much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go back in science and more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that <unk> categories.
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but it is within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of it was put in a pen in front of the nose, and if it was still <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma actually a person's death, and this is placed in a hard situation that we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
And in politics I'm progressive, and <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he puts me nervous.
You know, that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were thinking about.
It will come from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every bit of looking at that <unk> musical music, and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with creationists.
Parents <unk> the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And, as you all remember that, what we <unk> our collaborators.
The old monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right birth.
They had the concept of blood blood.
They were from the idea that it was coming to the political power of the blood right by the father and then the father and then and so on.
Parents had rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They went to the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> but it was very radical.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of the Parents -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> that was passed from a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talked about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundation of the future of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that are <unk> the <unk> of the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow Food movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention -- I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't mean that we need to get it to anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years were allowed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be strategy.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June June 1, 1980.
Henry, for the contrary, was born on the March of March at 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all three months before at Henry -- the right to sex consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I don't tell you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> required that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on your part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage than Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved in both the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw online somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas has decided that to get married with a man you don't have to have chromosome and to get married with a woman you have to have Y.
Now, in practice they don't make evidence for people who do <unk>
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I "I love <unk> it gives <unk>
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems very good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I also want to point out that I'm also not sure that we need to deal with this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more the social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can take more <unk> intelligent decisions about their sexual relations than the people of 40 that I know.
So how do you put the theme of content <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an <unk> maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we want to really reach that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to stand to a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins to then pick them out, and then they would get their fame.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum rather than the <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change in the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as I could have been, if we had given greater involvement to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular, if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, because I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all -- but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk>
What do you have to have the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, most of it has seemed to be something else in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were very aware of the way to protect the people in the state of the state, it is possible to have put more <unk> to this concept, maybe we have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get to respect democracy beyond <unk> thinking less about the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union and think about what we do each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to deal with <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could be able to make the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But you just put it through buildings in apartments.
So imagine that half of the ones who wanted to live in apartments are already owners and to the other half still not to do it.
They could try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have the rules to avoid the <unk> and the qualities of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new, building a building building building a whole new apartment building.
So I proposed that the governments to prescribe new reform zones of reform -- large cities and I gave them a name of cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75 percent of them will come up with their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we will <unk> and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents in apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of the technologies for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us forward.
In 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, "You know, this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are the cities, much more valuable than their cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to be transferred and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to make this project, this is important, this could be the way our country is going on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was about explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 or a thousand square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be an option of a city that might be able to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of hundreds of miles away toward the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to establish and make the norms of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could have a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these developmental regions.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the vote in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting voting on one.
Immediately after the voting voting at the age of 21 to 24, a <unk> delegation in the world was the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this as practical ways, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second town.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> and the time to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the ultimate court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There's urban planners and builders which are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to move through the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There are a million a year to come out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, and sometimes they are <unk> mothers who have to make the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred all around the world?
What does it seem to be thinking about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a confession to -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, including -- and more recently, to photograph and publish on my blog suits and colorful and different for each time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I will go to know <unk> people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like color to me.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive -- so I feel that I've won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anybody have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven <unk> and nothing else.
It's just one week for exactly one week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking at TED on underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this I call brilliant tiger
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
Almost you can always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
And all the together, including <unk> made me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I have used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be <unk> or I remind them of their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
If you think you look well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at it that you can't see <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a <unk> personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week this week, just for what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I find out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physical physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We just put them to play with them, and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition at that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, I always <unk>
But I bet that play with that parking bar I showed you a valuable lesson, and it is that the great things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that can be in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist of particles, because they don't play with bars and parking parties, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics of a few years ago: you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those tiny particles.
But it didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit me well to my logic.
Because if everything is made out of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't should.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to broaden a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we make a good focus on the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a demonstration of metal, and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip again, and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a way of swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of rare things, but then when other people go up with me -- I leave those things, because I don't want them to be <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The classmates of the inanimate objects are not only people -- it's also the light that it takes it, and the wind that happens on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics -- we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled it all over the air, and then we put it at a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like he wants to.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it was like a breathing of this form -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft drive, we could make it <unk> and we don't think about the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because watch this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal piece is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal piece and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal may be in two different places, why not you as well?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we turned it up, and we turned the lights on, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal still was there in one piece.
And I could get this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
So those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And I was 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that he was here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and me.
And a lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a whole bunch of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is simply explaining to this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to do it more accessible through technology.
So we form a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better that show the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have taken out of their launch.
So <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there is.
There's the gallery gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art museum Museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click -- and we click <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and <unk>
You want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the plane, and with one click, we jump inside.
They are inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
It will keep going. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> signal.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million pixel away.
And there are many people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixel away.
It can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I went into and discovered that the children were actually playing something.
And I was talking a little bit, I talked to some people about the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> on the <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you really see what there is.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find out detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things more here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum -- create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, you walk in, I've created this function I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just done a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things to you, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like when you look at these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things do not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media makes justice in the art that is represented in the line.
And the great question that make me today is: You can do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I have something to show you.
Think about it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I am from Italian, all the children in Italy grew up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
It was some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, and you would take a budget and take it to a very good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough -- you made the career.
This is that, in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting <unk> in the air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently.
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As if you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
It's kind of like almost all of the atoms in the existing atoms -- they turned out sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end I took the hammer and he threw the hammer and he threw it in the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup
Maybe some of you remember it, they were playing with Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the invisible activity of the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line line is on the top.
At the late evening there are people here and there are called <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people make a film called <unk>
Second time. End of time.
First time you get a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
Make Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day everyone went into the center of the winning team and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but about things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the <unk> of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small labels to track the crap on its shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are in all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
And with this information, we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't have existed.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> doesn't stop that there is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still still still still still still still there.
That if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the beginning, which is to push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
Everything started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> valves who open up and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you get the pixels to be able to write in them, I'll show patterns, images texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to mayor <unk>
He liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building to the gate of <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows -- but when you come up with it open so you can come in.
The roof is also coated with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> on the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, and someone who was there, and he said, "You know, <unk>
No, it's not that you have <unk> but when almost all the architecture is gone.
This is working.
You see the people who are looking at what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not stop trying to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open for you -- but a building that kept <unk> and water holes, and you had to jump down to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels -- the pixels of water and the pixels on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
So imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, which moves with other in synchrony.
Could we make this cloud, and we could make this cloud.
So a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal and in three dimensions, which is the light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appear on different scales and size, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can zoom in, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with a entrance that comes from people, of the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best folk dancers today, the <unk> star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left see the <unk> the catch on different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time <unk>
It can be <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the road.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as an input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of us take a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power of the power of the power of the physical world in the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it may be to deal with the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively, collectively,
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel there.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered the pixel here.
You can move around the inside, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom -- to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go inside there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I would tell you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure themselves.
What about good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you know most about you.
What do you wish to do if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to make creativity?
Raise your hands. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you get <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Ah, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "No in biology makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the most interesting thing.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the most bacteria in the most bacteria than the cells that we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> raises the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm up, dark below, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort in part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush to the <unk>
But by that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help to digest nutrients from <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or is it meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast <unk> <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I noticed something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms, every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two daughters cells.
But when the organisms come up, the organisms will start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the onset of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every year I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
And in front of him is a gorgeous <unk> dancer clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> he says George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get healthy.
I wanted to regain the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of moving the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic charges to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that everyone else is the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk> not <unk>
Evolution does not necessarily support the longevity.
It doesn't necessarily match the biggest or the stronger or the stronger and even the smartest and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish out there, so we have fish in there, and yet they've managed to make it a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at what's happening in the evolution of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look back at the <unk> phase -- I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first one is not <unk>
We've got a kind of <unk>
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, in the first place, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that it fits us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation of the necessary thing to happen.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional species, natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when we sort of <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility and terrifying possibility of it.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes at the individual and family level.
Think about that if it could also be able to be able to choose not only sex from their <unk> but in their own body make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes for eliminating diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, in 1990, and she sued 13 years.
<unk> billion dollars.
As a year of finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 base pairs at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in a week.
Not a lot of matter to make the human genome reality, and be more and more at the end of all.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin is able to make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to replicate other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against the flu vaccine in cells in a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
So imagine only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or the <unk> or changing the <unk> egg, and giving her children a better chance of a healthier life, remove the diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also have a better memory of <unk>
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want to have to have the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take a hundred and we can take it down to 1,000 years and maybe occur within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren in their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose different selectively attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society which is more boring and more robust or more robust and more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust or more robust
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants here.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem: You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that is not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
So imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then he said three words.
The most <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. The life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never implemented.
As I thought about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to be <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
And the second thing I learned that day -- and this is as the <unk> the bridge George -- which was not a lot of -- I thought I think, "I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also I gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about time that I think about things that didn't matter with people I know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14 <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I went back, I had the feeling of, "You know, she will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to be <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- the first grade, not much artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a little bit like a little bit like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
And at that point, I get to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And I was given another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live in another way.
You're flying today, the challenge you are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What do we <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do they change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And the most important thing are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total paralysis, as well.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk with Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the film called <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they will make it with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check and rather than signed a check I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to be <unk>
I was shocked, with his brother and his father there at that very closely moment, <unk> OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about it, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on their inner inside it can't be <unk>
So I talked at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> which have a technology that lets you project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the <unk> attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot moving the things on one side to another one, we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that it could give you a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the <unk> world of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, and the children and I moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we would do something completely stupid and when they had taken out, they would have taken off the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> ride -- my son was partly -- my dog was also, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of sunglasses on cheap sun that we buy in the Aristotelian trip of Beach, some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and that's free -- and we published the code -- we published the code, the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of teaching me all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking car outside the hospital.
And he turned to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent me an email and this was what he would say, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody came to <unk> and they would take me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
So in a way, this is our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the Los Angeles <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at the moment.
Do you do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and excited me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to do every day when we find out with something that we feel like if it's not right now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years -- in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time a lot of dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
It is difficult in <unk> difficult and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating a little bit of a lot of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in great part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations on <unk> with the only goal to deal with social questions with the only goal of trying to deal with social questions in ways that we want <unk> attractive, and, hopefully analyzing a way that they see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered them to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was the next thing that was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and the content I could do with the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity for it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me to have asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, examined the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be done for something as hard or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try to make a film about products, and the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The greatest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The greatest film ever ever <unk> is that everything on top of the top at the end, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people would be transferred to the film for <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more for <unk>
Was it <unk> <unk>
But not only are we going to have the brand of X brand in the title -- but we're going to make sure that we have all the categories that we could in the film.
You may have a shoe -- you may be the most cool shoe that you've ever got.
The most cool car you've ever driven on the largest film, the best drink than you have <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of the life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Doing the <unk> MS: And we actually show the full process of how it works.
The film of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the full idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> you know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how much <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to be <unk> I don't know if you're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A and a half and a half and a half and a half a <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth trying to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or for being me?
JK: All things on.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought it was <unk> that meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies disappeared.
None of it wanted to have nothing to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of the advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make that as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the <unk> media, is not the idea to tell the new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you're looking for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your <unk>
This was the problem: the <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line probably the biggest issue.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president the president -- even the CEOs of the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really change it changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> -- like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>  Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
Let's get an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to have a story -- <unk> story.
What we want to do is, we want a story, but <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was stuck in some lie -- and there is he staring at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John <unk> and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take a proxy for me and go to business myself.
So what I started to see -- all of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking about companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, massive movies, others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood film movies say that the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands they have to have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The greatest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you to <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would offer one of these great <unk>
Both <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man as a solid, <unk> solid, in the bar, like this.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We're a little <unk>
<unk> to the smallest type of movies that <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
He is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you can put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something new, <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It is <unk>
How do we keep them cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: So, my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good thing.
Woman: Let's revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: So I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, a lot like this.
Usually I'm wearing himself as sunglasses, and I like crystals and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man #2: the brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: You know, <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
We have toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
And in my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often get away at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they could do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next is this is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what do you do that?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk>
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of mountains are you?
MS:
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
And there was a lot of crazy in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> on your personality personality -- <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk>
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of it.
And I think some companies will only get into one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them a <unk> and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first one here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS:
If somebody asks you to take your identity of brand, your personality self, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute of somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are they rather <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic <unk>
Or are you more about attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have nothing to do with this film, mainly because they didn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how now MRI is using MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain as well as a movie marketing as a movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting way into the schools with money problems in the United States.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I have most successful are the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what they did these brands.
They took the <unk> out to their donor agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to treat it directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you gone? They did it <unk>
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival just take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The movie doesn't get <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even introduced in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to gain lead.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies we talked about giving their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks that in those risks is opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that are actually pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees at the risk of risk by risk is preparing their whole company for <unk> rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we need to be afraid of fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
And I fear fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the peril.
And finally, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than ever -- I'm going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who had been bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> great data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I was going to get on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED Lab, the Foundation Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED next year.
The idea behind the worm computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes do not use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we could put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box, damages the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the end of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems systems.
So that struck us the attention -- and we started an experiment where we had a <unk> environment, and we saw what was going on with this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't have any sense to me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place: on.
If it doesn't, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could be, say, for example, a energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled it up and put the attack code, and we found that I was <unk> in two bomb bombs and a big big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people that obviously had the entire internal data.
Let's get all the points for you to attack.
You probably even know how much they would go back to the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and from high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential cities of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> must be an valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
So rotor is that mobile piece in the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to <unk> engineers so they could not solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the <unk> digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> on that code, you can't get <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code.
A nearly <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would tell one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We need no to worry about other targets for <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There is the gray box and the up you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides code, which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these false data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds video <unk>
It's <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes out of speed, you have to open gas valves into a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator to do.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have such a <unk> that disseminate this load with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It will be used as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces in large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start to make right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done on many sides that people assume the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My belief is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, again, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give them <unk> <unk> or other than making the users on the wheelchair and get it back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in the morning, it gives you a great force that will also increase your speed, and it aid, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other sentient beings.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on your back a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's being <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important <unk> -- injury on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to my back.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> web <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can borrow it 90 pounds of habitat for many hours.
And its flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users on the wheelchair, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, at the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a lot of very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that would start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talked about the population that gets bigger and so quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors -- it has a few sensors ...
It was completely unaware of the crutches that send the computer signals on board, on the back.
There are also some batteries that give the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing down the bottom of the <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything and everything went down the <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you'll never get to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last part of the hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down to <unk> climbing rocks and riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of the wheelchair, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, they meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest life <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created special things, because this leads to a very tolerant society, where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also will put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation make you fill in a stadium with the bonobos and the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos. You can hear the laughter that is hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes that we know as physical apes -- love, not <unk> because they have sex and <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how to play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yes.
So the sex game is common both in bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think that, as it were, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and harder world more and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a success world that changes have to play.
But let's go back to the maximum <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human beings by the same way, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate play, you can be the moments in which the most urgent is the most urgent time.
And so <unk> <unk> we accept this gift of evolution and play together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, it's <unk> and fires as a captain assistant in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are accepting a highly skilled staff, you have to get the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a career on foot on the other volunteers to get the captain to charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- came up to the captain and asked him to go back and would save the dog owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a blank building to save a live building just because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go into the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
<unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I put up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went back to the firemen -- and that height was that height of the fire and I entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for the owner of the house where, as they would expect, their treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
So the kindness that she watched for anything else was that someone had gotten even a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as the <unk> fireman and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage and courage too.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are at the <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you to remind you to remind you of this.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, I'll get it right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save people's lives, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first block of concrete is built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules from a fixed measure that fit in each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges or bridges or bridges at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, we came up with this.
He called it brick from assembly <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks for each person on the planet.
You don't have to be able to be building beautiful bridges or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block -- the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block is that the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuits and more complex ways, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through magnets.
So you can't get in a wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the stream, blue is the stream, and the <unk> is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make major circuits.
One blue with a green one is producing light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We have this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures, gestures on.
To make it faster or slower -- it just looks like this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a growing.
We want all interactions in the world to get together bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light of night, or why the door door door is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We have led to design design schools.
So for example, the <unk> designers start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers from Rhode Island School -- that they don't have any experience in engineering -- just and wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the end of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, and inventors because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for the environment focused on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This isn't ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I mean, this is the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do -- we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> of Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World -- we send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
Let's get <unk>
This is a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody else has to clean it, when it is caught up by the snow because it knows that it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- very much last year.
They realized that the city has never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members of Erik <unk> noticed something else that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You get <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a big uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for the systems of <unk> <unk> when seeing this app realized that I could use it not for snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are becoming the batteries.
That's why citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks out when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has spread it out of it, and it has a organic and natural manner.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this isn't happening.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal channels that would have taken at least two and half a million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the California court of California that until the time has a half billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of shot of warning at the institution of the government.
It suggests the best government ways to work, not as in private companies, like many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they would bring together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
Do you feel a lot of frustration before that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that get crazy -- the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask them to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government is.
And given that the government ultimately built out of us -- remember that, <unk> the <unk> The way this is going to affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is, especially <unk>
This is the heart of law enforcement and information center.
It's the place that serves the phone calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the official of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, putting music very hard music and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has not a call center.
It has a <unk> website and mobile phone called <unk>
I don't know that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really came up with this <unk> <unk> on my bucket of crap. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I would come up with the place, I found the cube of crap behind the house.
<unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical things.
And it's also a great example of the government for the government to collaboration with distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to stand and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
We connected two people.
And it could have been connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor will help each other, we get the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the gate of the other.
That our entry to the government system is <unk>
How many times have we chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is <unk> our values and we think about our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the superficial superficial layer of 15 feet.
That's why we call it <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which is that it belongs to us, which is that we funded as something that we built in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a bunch of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report for 325 pages of response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is <unk>
And for the ones that we have faced with government, it's time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is that it is possible with technology to root the root function of government so that it can be able to expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm an older generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that nearly granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to be <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem facing the government doesn't matter so much to do hear their voices.
They're using hands.
They bring hands to the work to program applications that make a better job for the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out, dumping a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in our prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here are impact around the world.
And sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning,
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up at a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in the slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way the world saw the world.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at her, she was approaching me, and I gave me a good hug.
I was so hard to barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I was going to tell me about it again, and if I was saying yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are the two <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't know it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that you will always be the right thing to be done if the right thing is <unk>
I thought it was and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third I want you to tell me is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We just get the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, offered to my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You would say, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What is you? Take a <unk>
It landed my gaze with <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to say something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably wasn't supposed to say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that it is a <unk> I mean by the power that identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that actually don't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe that we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been inmate during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, we need to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In the poor or black, they find so much <unk> so much despair.
One in three black classes between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail in jail for parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, of all young people in the color are in jail, or in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that comes to you so much better if you're rich, and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our own problem.
We're <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at the work of some pretty curious work.
In my state in Alabama, as in other states, we have no rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they reported to children from 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for kids, without a possibility of getting back.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They will go to people at the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes, but if we deserve killed.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Out of every nine people <unk> has identified one which is innocent and liberated from the death row.
One of a mistake, you know, a innocent rate in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation we would not allow you to ever be able to fly airplanes if every nine that you would have, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> I talk to you about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, you talk about slavery, I talk about slavery, I talk about slavery, I talk about slavery, I talk about slavery, I talk
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a very little kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were concerned to be <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are people who are older than me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, <unk> Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we have historically done.
All of the time I get to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not be overcome the race <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany going on the death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you want.
We don't have a death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room became silence and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we put to <unk>
Let's think about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. Tell creativity to us.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
I think, you need to integrate both things.
And lately we're talking about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that will never come to TED.
If you think about them, in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though it's so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
And with innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things are coming from ideas -- also by the <unk>
This is the connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in <unk> and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to the poverty, the <unk> to inequality to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young, young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk.
Occasionally, the <unk> lady was called me to go, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and get <unk>
I said, "I know I do."
And so she said, "Well what do you do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks came to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that it's that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help the ones that have been actively <unk>
We try to confront the <unk> and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population on prison.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of the end, and he looked at me and said, "Hey, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got me my finger in the face and said, "Is that because you have to be very much but really <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't blame it, not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> not <unk> you don't judge us from our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich powerful way to the rich, powerful and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they are given to them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge convert someone in what it doesn't is?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
And one night I was very late -- my God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old <unk> a small poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated as a privileged white white, executive from a <unk>
And in the <unk> I had been <unk> in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, but I had been sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court for this stupid.
I got on the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went on to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black man, she was the <unk>
When he saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he's <unk> "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I approached me and <unk> me.
And I got rid of the ear, and I got in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That is deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
And I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we start to argumentation.
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up with the police officers who are the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and we all miss because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye hit the <unk> which was going to be <unk>
He would look out the window and get it to hear all that <unk>
He <unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black white, <unk> face entered the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
And for the break a <unk> he showed because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black man.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, "I've looked at this audiences in order to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal of <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds up towards justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
What our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a clear desire for the audience, from this community, to help in your case, do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities -- close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, they're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes get nothing.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's said that it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The huge growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of this punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> to rob a bicycle, by small crimes against property -- instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you really excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or from the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every single second of the day our senses are receiving so much more data than the brain may be able to <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all that data is an old clip from the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the detector, danger.
<unk> and records all of the information looking for something in the environment that could harm us.
And so for a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative ones.
That old old saying of <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news -- the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not surprising that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe what happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of the species, lack of water and <unk> and <unk>
As humans, we are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income is <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communication and communications has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy was 25 to over 25 to over 80 percent to more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> expectations more and lower.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> television, mobile, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
You know, a lot of this is technology and, lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and <unk> in a recession, in the recession, in the <unk>
It is the end of the record of rapid computers used to make computers faster.
It doesn't stop in any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve is going up.
The growth rate of technology is now faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computer and networks, robotics, 3D computing, and the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production of all the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuels and the food and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" -- <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I love this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have a <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every <unk> it's about creating a life of what possible.
It's about taking that thing that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
Tell dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon had covered with silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with covered with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of this was to Washington is of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet we have for 5,000 times more energy than we used in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about authors, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT came up with a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars by water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager Voyager Voyager toward Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
It was a famous picture. How did it be <unk>
"A pale point.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, which is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> their technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small fridge ago.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of water drinking a day of any source of <unk> water water, a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola is going to be in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that drogue warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you a smart smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of the abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever been.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video -- images of books and music, computing technology, <unk> <unk> now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing about it when it comes up with health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Science Foundation, which was called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the world teams so that we have these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has <unk> they can be able to be able to extract blood from finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the <unk> burden is 25 percent of the health worker.
When this device was <unk> a RNA virus, or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world.
I call it the <unk> billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection of the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, switching from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before you get into the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do we <unk> What wishes is it <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide 3,000 billion more members of human humanity, polite and <unk>
What about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
So what did these three billion?
And if you are contributions that we can't afford to do.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided equipment for his passion with a goal of course, can do things that could only do the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some has already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this college teachers in the other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together, and they started <unk>
And it's been shown today that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the <unk> capital.
And we have three billion different minds that we are interested in to work on the solution of the great challenges and do what we need to do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them like very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot of the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 meters, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped down in half.
I went down to five centimeters old.
It is a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing in changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> in the <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 dollars <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad boat, he called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in southern China Sea <unk> and, above all, on the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
So let's go through it, now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are <unk> tiny little bit about <unk> remains that they're fish from coral reef.
In short, the sea bottom came up on the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
And in a year, you make a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line of being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This is the mountain of remains that they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they've never had fish.
But it wasn't <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
We have the starting point, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this, something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things that are biodiversity, biodiversity, amounts of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images that are aware of the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they pick up the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the planning of changes.
And at the end of the end, it will keep the <unk>
And that, in great measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects the people when the societies will kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal which is very ubiquitous, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose normal animals.
Even if this is not being perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and at a poor ocean of big fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain of <unk> like a lot of fish in this area cannot be used -- or usually they don't use the scientists in the fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can make a protected area.
Because with the marine areas of the marine areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That is for the people that you can see a protected area and you can benefit from the vision that you can -- which enables you to erase your point <unk>
And what happens with the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were very touched with the film to talk about the story of <unk> why do we deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is Cameron, I do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos do and what matters to that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper tonight in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can do famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage gets viral gets a myriad of <unk> and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of innovative communities and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his home in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of the last summer.
<unk> was not meant to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had published lots of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I was going to get to the popularity of the <unk>
<unk> as Jimmy <unk> shows us new things and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You want to start the Friday.   Everybody wants to get the end of the week, the weekend week.   <unk> on Friday.  KA: We would think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Saturday day.
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view and share with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great piece of internal <unk> then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation, with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three of three hours that has seen four million times.
And until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that looked at other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet community <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old version.
And then it did.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form in.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk>
What are the script could have been written by the <unk>
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, only that only <unk> and unexpected can be <unk> so these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the <unk> in New York, I admit, I didn't get interested in.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> <unk> for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that get you properly from the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise that the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> I got to get five to five million you see and understand your idea.
So this approach is worth for everything else that we do in a creative form.
And all this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative communities of participation, the whole unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of popularity as well.
As I said before, one of the celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're barely the current media -- but it <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only one unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now do it <unk>
It <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old, when his father died, and a little <unk> and two small little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a task that was given to the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a four years that defies fiction, a boat <unk> into the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
All the adults knew about risks.
The greatest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we were asked -- first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady pace of the motor, the <unk> diving on every wave, and the vast horizon, and a vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they had been fooled with the bravery of men in our boat, or the <unk> engine and not being able to pluck for six hours.
But I know the lights on the operating platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the trip was too much for it; and the first apple that I decided to have given for the men in the platform.
No apple had later the same thing.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of migrants
Unlike the average class suburbs of class -- the existence of the middle class -- there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line of cars, working six days, double turn.
And still, I found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
And all the dollars were <unk> and established one extra <unk> in English and math, wouldn't mind what you should be supposed to do, which was usually <unk>
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
One thing is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would get away about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> every ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until its nightmares started to be able to get <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> boys who were caught between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student relentless with what I <unk> myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse, and isolation.
But many given help through the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer they elected the young Australian young student.
And I was <unk> out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident in <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist, invited to speak on sites that there was never heard of, and in homes whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the shareholders, and the comfort of life at a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day for almost 20 years ago, <unk> on the day of every day and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she came up with the ship.
The "no" had ever been an option.
He said, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it, more <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what we were going to live on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's OK to be a stranger, a little twist on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism sort of humility and <unk>
So I kept following my intuition.
So let's go to a small group of people who the motto cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was doing a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
It was going to be <unk> at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later there was <unk> and <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
With the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she was itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't make it proven to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, a <unk> <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people we were and how life came into us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat there would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to know?
I fear the privilege of the easy, the privilege of the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them a safe and do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this today, on the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
And in those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane.
At that time, when the great prince came, the Indian warrior had <unk> he had a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I was given to this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't get to my friends.
It seemed that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this piece of the 50 years was the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, from hackers.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to you.
Our inspiration.
So I was going to tell me, I got stuck to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book out.
Where do we are.
They put the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, "Do you get your fingers on each light."
And this --  he says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
At a number of moments it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which comes to me.
My little girl inside these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons, but that magic of childhood, those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt up the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light up your way into what my way out of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me about a child was that a whole galaxy is in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is turned into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In the entire fantasy book, there has always been maps but static maps.
This is a map that grows, and they guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it was also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important thing to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We all have heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts who are <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't.
So to regain this childhood ritual of childhood you have to go out and in a chapter, you put a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a photo of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is created a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a photo of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have gone taking.
Within the kind of connection between the magic, the Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and through and through <unk> you see a group of cartoons that appear on the plants inside the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology to each other.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're moving into our children and ourselves in the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you think?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the major problems for what everyone, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to listen to listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a doorknob on moving and shut down.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent of the <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time that I need assistance assistance or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 12,000 Twitter on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect my scale to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure that are used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move the people out of their chairs and together develop some activity to have more control of their health.
From next week is available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their homes, take their blood pressure, to take their medical pressure, to share them with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of the health care because of the challenges we face, the firing of attention to the <unk> of attention to the <unk> of the demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video of a video.
We all have navigation controls, in the <unk>
Maybe we have in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs in <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked ourselves, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did is we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please see <unk> where, and when it's open, when you are open, sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are shut down.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality.
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone, to find the most close <unk> what it can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish to go globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities to help us find and work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> worldwide.
Every time you're from vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us think of these <unk>
You could be <unk> or people from <unk> for example, if the <unk> which is shown is still in place.
Please wake up in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my <unk> <unk> but it was a little bit different because I used the camera that process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you press the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that starts to press the <unk>
It was like this: a construction on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And in spite of it, it keeps a <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the reality level to keep the <unk>
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in a way like photography.
You know, you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them real?
They're the details or <unk>
<unk> the light?
What do you create the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's all about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly immersive objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it's combined in a certain way, you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
This is really in combining different <unk>
And the things that make a photo look like realistic I believe that they are those in which we don't even see the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs, it's very important to be <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will follow for realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> must have the same type of light.
And these two images have done with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same type of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect union box.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of different kinds of places.
I think it's easier to create a place that would find a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had a number of months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The beaches are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, even I did <unk> the home of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and the <unk>
All the tools are there, and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram of anybody I took of a folder, mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other that we tend to see, is a sort of a straight line in <unk>
In other words, every step of this represents an order of magnitude, on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
This is something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology I would like to give you the diagram would see something ludicrous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you take it for example, some other technology, like transport, in a <unk> curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a change <unk>
If the technology of transportation was as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of economic growth that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve, I know how to be something totally different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe this is something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
This line is in a transition from what used to be the world in a new way.
And so what I'm trying to ask, is, what is that new way that <unk>
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
It happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that they extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how could that transition that you <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back for about 2.5 billion years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would go around them.
So if we look at the way that chemicals were organized we give us an idea of how things were.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was some <unk> oil with all kinds of prescriptions in their inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside and the droplets grew up grew up grew up grew a lot of <unk>
They started <unk>
In a sense, those were the more <unk> cell forms of oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> it was <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow will be improved as being better at building the <unk> chemists more -- more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a very simple form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things are <unk> interesting when these drops -- they learned the trick.
In some ways that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to be able to be able to do.
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here are 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and put it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was a interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then there was another big step of interesting step in which things got very different and that was that these cells started to swap and communicate information forming that cell communities, cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin, and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place communities that, in a way, they were put together on it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether it was that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community to get away more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities became so close that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community of the community on a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities that are emerging communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles of the brain, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and they've produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the <unk> that these cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> and the <unk> structures and to transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism -- and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn how to eat a certain fruit because he knew bad, and he got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these data processing structures that have been able to have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit line.
So the fact that the nervous system built those data structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the more <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention,
I have a very complicated idea.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, the sound sequences -- and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now spend through similar periods of organisms that are <unk> our <unk> methods -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on. It's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than what we do before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that told you it took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
The other, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, it's like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates their own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve, the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I do I make a life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent tech.
But now design objects of such complex complexity that would be impossible for me to communicate in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor is in that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine, and we put it on the machine and the machine with that something that we didn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, it's evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the time scale.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please <unk> you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those that are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order to numbers.
Of course, you may have some random sequences of instructions, so you have no numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, to take two programs, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
Do you have some mutations here.
And it tries again and it is <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in very few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders in just the perfect way.
In fact, they're very much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it, to see how they work.
It's very strange programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives depended on this.
Once I was going on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at that.
It says, "You have hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to deliver a <unk> flight -- doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we used these programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these very quickly.
So it is <unk>
The thing is going faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part of thinking that we are the end of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes in.
But now it comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get away.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to allow me to give a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going out <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> which will be 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of the time.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to deal with the first base of it, didn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, this is someone who 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of the League of <unk> in a regular season in a regular season.
Now I will take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a dear self has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and his family doctor is moving into a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's actually improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you think should be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
It's very good.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do is, though, is send them to the world, and I would call me the <unk> of being perfect.
That ever, would never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medicine.
I was an Protestant <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs is going to be studied until a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic and differential differential and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very nice. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the school of medicine with the impression that if it was going to take everything, it would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the <unk> lady in the emergency service where I worked worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist got me going to that patient response.
And to report to the chief of residents.
When I saw the <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I got it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart leaves it and instead of pump the blood ahead, the blood goes into lungs, these are <unk> and so there is a difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that we would love with.
I gave it <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on their heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> the sent to his house.
I actually made it two more errors in fact.
I sent it to his house without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't pick up the phone or did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, I would have been able to contribute <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that was going to be a constant <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made that was worse.
When I send it to your house, I wasn't paying attention to a voice in my inner hand, which said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse who <unk> the <unk> "Do you believe it is okay if it goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so it was signed up with the ambulance and the ambulance next to the ambulance and led her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach, that afternoon, I had a <unk>
But I kept on my work.
At the end of the day, I would stop to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally,
It went through the emergency service service at home.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the <unk> lady before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: does it remember you?
He remembers from the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the tall, he was a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency pressure with a blood pressure of 50 mm in <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just barely breathe and she was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all its resources.
They gave it medication to raise the blood pressure.
They put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> it was in intensive care, and he was waiting for all hope that was <unk>
And in the age of two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And on the ninth day, they let them go. <unk> wife, <unk>
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was embarrassed for it and experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt single, isolated with feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford to have your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame it leaves a teaching.
The shame shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that happened.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would go on the things, and I made sure that I didn't give up.
And I kept doing those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I send it to his house?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little at the same feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day <unk> opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was going to spend the efforts to be perfect to not make more errors, I would leave to those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an emergency department in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little <unk>
He took it out of penicillin, and he sent him back home.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my parents' shift, my boss asked to speak with me in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
And he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He didn't die of it.
Did you get antibiotics on the Milky Way, and you've recovered every few days.
And I went through the same piece of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was taken to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
We had an X-ray of these, but it turned out a <unk> a colleague that was checking out to the patient -- we had a kind of sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it and see some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, right, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered well.
But every case <unk> me <unk>
But I would like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here is the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this so that it didn't make the same <unk>
If I would come up with a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the errors in other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own errors.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that you know, the ones who have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get into medicine to people who make mistakes are going to be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a personal study of bad healthcare, and errors in medical doctors, to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto, <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happens every single day, where one of each 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where the infections, infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die at the country die of <unk> medical errors, <unk>
The Institute of Medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added for every two or three years, and we didn't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, and I will stand with <unk> eyes, and I can breath to alcohol and suddenly my story is <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of -- and we eliminate all the professional professionals to mistake -- well, you wouldn't have any one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
And in my <unk> white, art -- it's already a custom say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone toward them.
And their students were <unk> to slow down the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, they know the human, they accept it, and they don't feel about their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for the support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are going on the system, and when this happens, they become mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but I strive for learning something that can transmit others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember that.
Do you know how many decisions we took a day to do.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
So recently I did a survey over 2,000 people, and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a average American is about 70 per day.
It didn't make a lot of a lot of a research went on for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time that we need to make decisions with these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
<unk> every job involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
You know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How does the way that we make those decisions?
Today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
So as I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive for giving you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> at the University of very, very <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water <unk> and this was when we got water <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never buy anything?
This is the shelf of <unk> oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I said, "Do you know, this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different classes.
You put a post for <unk> right at the tent.
We put it out there from six <unk> or 24 or 24 <unk> and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop and test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a decade ago that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> of <unk>
This is the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
What stood when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> us less -- it's less good to conserve <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices are affecting us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the decisions about savings for retirement from about a million Americans, from one million Americans, in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of drug offers available in savings plans to retirement the program -- <unk> to people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the greater the number of funds, there was less participation.
So if we look at the extreme point, we see that in the plans that they have two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of involvement on the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there's unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people will become <unk> by avoiding their actions or hedge funds.
As much as the more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial bill.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we have seen three negative consequences of the one of the more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we will make the decision, even when it goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take decisions in finance and in the health.
They are more likely to pick things out of <unk> even though I see it better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not capable of doing the calculations for comparing and choosing to choose that awesome <unk>
So today I want to take you -- four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But in fact, what we're seeing is that if you decide to get cut, to get rid of their strange <unk> options -- there will be a <unk> increase in sales, they will be <unk> there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation was eliminated on the products for you -- you know, the <unk> of cats grew up <unk> by two <unk> more sales and smaller costs.
You know that supermarkets, on average with 45,000 products.
In a tent, you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world today is <unk> and it's only 1,400 <unk> a type of tomato sauce
In the world savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is the drawing of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees of Harvard are automatically <unk> to a very insurance fund of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford to do their <unk> either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer the people in this audience a holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> OK. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, which in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must feel very much very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when it uses credit card or credit card than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make people worse.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting was exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the personnel who would think of the positive things that you would put in your lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent, and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine theater.
We saw that in supermarket Club along the <unk> of the <unk> the magazine exhibition can contain from <unk> different kinds of <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to which we have to do not have the <unk>
And you often see this problem with these massive <unk>
I am meant who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just put it a little bit of it.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- they buy a car.
This is a car manufacturer of cars that allow us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put your car.
And these decisions.
<unk> <unk> of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is actually vary the order of the order that the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to be a lot of choices, 56 colors, as many four boxes.
The other half of the clients will go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, so many options.
And what am I going to do?
How about you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who are going on a lot of options -- <unk> the default button over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was disrupt the order when the information comes in.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the change is not going to say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories.
All of these techniques that I have introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more <unk> we can be in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the <unk> East Germany -- if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to record a sheet of text text with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think someone could do this, how much that we would have -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a little yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very excited about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, enormous amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, let me make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and so on, etc.
These guys make their <unk> on the line, but they do it by illegal media by stealing money to steal money from our bills when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are being a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most of the <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, and they motivate the protests, they motivate them, they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States of the United States that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority authority, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the bottom of the last fall because of a <unk>
Let's get the security of the site and lead a <unk>
And last week I asked the Dutch government representatives of the Dutch government asked one of the leaders if they were going to say to one of the leaders of the Dutch government <unk> the death of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack from these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> an authority <unk>
It was happening <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the American secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros the government <unk>
The company is right here.
So the Western governments provide the tools to the government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it goes further.
You get the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I don't have anything to do.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that <unk> today, will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the south of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and the back of the cows, the National Park.
The National Park, it doesn't have fences in the most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out in the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
It <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead in the morning, because it was the only one <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
They were dying of people who protect our community and the won, and they're also angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park, in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to the nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that the lions was fear.
But I realized that it didn't really happen, because he was even helping the lions to see the car away.
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions so they believed it was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they turned out, and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I went on and they killed the animal.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come.
I found out that lions are afraid of light that it moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which it will turn off and turn off the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk>
It gets everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charges and the battery -- the electricity on the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions so that I am walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights on.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
And since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used now by the entire Kenya, to scare other predators like hyena <unk> and it's also used to absorb elephants elephants as well.
And because of this invention, I had the fortune to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and <unk>
He even took my friends into my community and we set up lights on the homes that don't have it, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see planes fly, and I would say it would someday be within you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become a aviation engineer, and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture the exciting thing that's to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in the other electrical <unk>
What's the next one on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a near electric -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that you invented electric structures, but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I took it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I had tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to <unk> every step I get to do with my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would go all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed a sudden.
When I was seven years, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister my sister.
And he said, "When we got this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We're moving together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we are ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I walked in front of the train, season, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine <unk> in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and just few survived eating grass, insects and crust of tree.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely on dark at night except for the sunlight lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries in the night.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river may be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to fall.
But many people die.
Sometimes, you see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how to go from North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> kin.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to go back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee refugees.
But I suddenly learned that it's not only very difficult -- but also dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they made a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum in <unk>
But many of them may be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were had been eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I've decided to be honored to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even it went through a whole identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a lot of mine.
Even though we went to life in South Korea it wasn't really easy, I did a plan. I started looking for the exam exam exam for the <unk>
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little money that sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China, and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a official Chinese police.
He asked the identification of everyone. And he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, and I stood up, and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did the whole way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards, <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month ago.
But the time my family was arrested and locked over again in the <unk> capital.
This was one of the lower dots in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at cut away from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come up and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a young man, "What is the problem?"
I was so stunned that a stranger would care ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I was telling him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I would love him with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why would you care?
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> is a new hope for me and for the village to go back to the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over the time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or none of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language, practice of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family care, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity for international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans worldwide, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the South Center name so that it would represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this is <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the Los Angeles   <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk> food.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert. The Los Angeles <unk> home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to bring kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I'm going to tell you that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see the flashy wheelchair and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see centers of <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of running 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a band of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me at <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep going.
So my group and I, L.A. -- Green <unk> we put together and started planting our food forest forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, nine <unk>
What we do is, we are a kind of paid paid from gardeners of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone is <unk>
The city came up with me and <unk> I was given a <unk> by saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> made command <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court command for planting food in a piece of land that no one would <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
Now, L.A. Times had the <unk> written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk> land.
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> billion plants.
Why on Earth does not seem like this?
You can take a plant to give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, they cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I was given to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Just like an artist of <unk> which <unk> walls -- <unk> soils <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you stop your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool for education, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how they affect boys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time, that came a mother and his daughter, <unk> like the <unk> of the night and were in my yard, and they looked very <unk>
I was -- well, man, I felt bad to be there, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> we don't assume that people will steal your <unk>
So I say, "Of God I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid that you're going to <unk>
It's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get the <unk> but at your time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refuge in a refuge in the Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me his stories about how this had affected me and how it had gone to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people coming from, and they work and they work on every volunteer.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this are being told if you don't teach them how food affects mind and body, eat blind what you put them in front of you.
And I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're busy seeing -- I see the color guys that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are engaged in their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George George D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all one block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to bring it into <unk> healthy.
I didn't give up.
I'm not talking about for free, because the free thing is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street to get the kids out of the street and know the joy, the pride and the honor of cultivating their own food, opening their farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to be in <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
What do you take the <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, that it goes on.
You can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bicycle and these cars go up, that's not very nice.
And asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to do asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the water water can flow down the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water will never get more.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all of the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
So what is <unk> You see that on this road the rocks on the surface of the surface.
First of the stone first and then several more and more and more, and so on, and you know, <unk> -- well, but you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more resistant.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt thing as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> the glue -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> it <unk> and if you <unk> it will be <unk> and you get out of the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this issue, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut <unk> <unk> into very small chunks, and we can mix these little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, particularly steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the flow of the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and the stones get back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine <unk> on the stage.
The microwave oven.
I put the show that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So we came up with a piece of road, 400 yards away from the <unk> highway, which we had to do a <unk> to test this stuff.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road will last a number of years -- no damage to that. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and we tested it in the lab.
We did aging for the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, the ones then with our <unk> machine, and we put it back and we put it back again.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, steel, fibers, bringing these fibers, using the <unk> energy to actually increase the life of the road, even you can double the life on the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, you have curiosity if this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it is just the repair of it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little gray radio.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed as my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban was engaged in Afghanistan and made illegal girls to be at school.
For the next five years, I was struck by a child for my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in stock bags so that we seem to seem to seem to be shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 percent of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And occasionally, school was suddenly rejected by a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you say?
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters was a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my daughter was to school, and so his father was going to get it out.
But my polite mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It leaves two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments that I was really frustrated about our life and was always scared and she didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. They can be able to leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that always will be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you don't want to stop it.
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the school, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't only get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I have spent on the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I sleep in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, and a global campaign to educate women.
It's why we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friends, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of a foreign opposition.
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed it's the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going from the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When I got to your house, they're the phone, a voice <unk> that if he was still sending her daughter to school, they would return to trying.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but we wouldn't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to you from Afghanistan, and it's something that's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and what you see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school are <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We would argue that these changes didn't last a lot, after the death of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, that I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day girls from <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution inspired by the waves of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other <unk> citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> we were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, they were consistent with freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a copy of the <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> and the East to the south.
Finally, after a six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50 thousand dead, we could release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a grave load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the culture and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, next to a lot of other women, rebuild the civil society, <unk> a transition to the right and fair to democracy and national reconciliation,
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started to organize workshops about developing capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we started the Women of Women <unk> <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our <unk> to <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> of an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved, and successful.
The women won a <unk> of National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
But shortly in little, the exhilaration of elections and revolution like everything, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their nonstop violations.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mindset -- and it has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
It stops <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm right here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose wrong, we made the wrong thing.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because elections didn't brought the peace of peace and stability and security and security.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the dialogue of national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election, that just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the gender representation, of women more than going to need the representation, and we tried to do that.
We need to stop acting like agent agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting like agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but also to put it in practice the mercy instead of <unk> the <unk> of the competition, the inclusion instead of the <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, Libya, <unk> desperately needs to get to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it was <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which spans the whole thing that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns are <unk>
And like the uterus -- just like the uterus covers the <unk> the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
This is what it looks like to us, "My partnership, is <unk>
This is what it looks like to us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They will all be told by the mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question that has a equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that all make a chance. Why is it left?
Why was anybody going to stay with a man who was going to be <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. He was just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved me to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first apartment, the American <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, the man, I believed my soul <unk> I went to the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets of <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year and even some men.
It could be their story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all the races, all the other levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships -- <unk> and <unk> or said otherwise, in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who sticks with a man who sticks and actually went a very typical victim of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of the 16 and 24 years old, the women of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year for partners, and <unk> and husbands were <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical <unk> because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started with me with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it looked like a field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a little hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made me <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me, who was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was so that <unk> in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and the brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and letting my dreams, but I thought I'd have to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I went back, let me quit my work and <unk> and I went back to Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> that I was getting into a head in a physical trap and a very carefully psychological trap <unk>
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how they react to.
And this is where they come into the scene.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where they were supposed to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
I had it in the <unk> of the car.
And then he threw it underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small day.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually was a message for me and, although I never had lifted my hand, my life was really serious about every single minute every day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were the seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I got the girlfriend suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
I just had felt very <unk> for the wedding, and the fact that it was a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never hurt me.
I spent twice as much as our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so hard in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey. It was taken by the traffic and threw a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> or two times a week for the next two and half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So I'll go back to my question: Why do I get it?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was <unk>
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us face their <unk>
The other question that everyone else does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why did I not care about it, I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we, because we are victims, we know something that you normally <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the law of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to <unk> <unk> of financial resources, and the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their kids, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet, we still ask why it's simply not going up.
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> back that my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everyone over the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family and full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the tendency to engage victims like headlines, <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people that is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally get rid of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also had heard that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them, and that they gave their lives lives and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I became married with a <unk> man, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have ever ever more, would ever be a charged gun pointing up to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this point, just like you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which silly -- but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were in small or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love love by breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> alone in silence.
They have the power to end the domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They were talking about the abuse of the light talking about it with their kids, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene in a <unk> to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe manner.
And together we can turn our bed, our boards and our families and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have had it like that.  Fortunately, I brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of power to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh on me, so you don't do anything while you cover my mind.
All right.
So why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but they also <unk>
I have changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that I was going to get the back of my back and <unk> the baby hair.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan like the one I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow it has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this scenario because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in fact, <unk>
The first question is, how do you become model?
And I always say, a <unk> discovered, but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry of which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage, heritage that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> they have the fashion that they were going to go on, they are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing about models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is that less than four percent, they were not white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't give it to that.
But then what I would really tell you every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon called <unk> ninja and <unk> which would be awesome, as you are the first.
If this list was still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head chief chief of American magazine or the <unk> executive or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you first want to be model is like to say that you want to make the lottery when you get older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model -- because, unlike the <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've taken your studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your backs, no matter what I think -- you want to be president of the United States, no matter what you would like to be president of the United States, but your name is <unk> Model clothes for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a little part of what happens.
And this was the first picture I was talking about, and I was also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're going into the personal field, but it was a child.
So it looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is, let's do things for free?
I have too much heels. I have to never use, except the <unk> but the privileges I get is the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for power to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of what they are.
I live in New York City, and the last year of the <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
And when I research for this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure out to 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe they would do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with clever people, clever people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, you know, with a smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a models, because they have the most equal legs -- the brighter hair and their clothes -- but it's probably the physically <unk> women <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to keep in this talk, I hope that they all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no chance to repeat the pictures, not even very minimum in lighting.
In fact, most of them took a chance.
My story starts when <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and 5.
He gave it back to New York City a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you fall to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to take us that picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera is so universal.
No one has ever denied and, fortunately, nobody has ever <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a three-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a <unk> point or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week of October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when suddenly was stopped in my dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the Barbie store that <unk> from small <unk>
And it described to me what I had felt about the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I didn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't stop on to someone and asked, "Can you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most unequal birds group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney involuntary <unk> like <unk> dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- and you have laughter, applause and <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with the Parliament.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World which is largely in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why do we <unk> them are serious -- first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the carcasses up to the bone.
They help to kill all of the bacteria all the bacteria to absorb anthrax than they would spread and caused great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of diseases.
The <unk> also have enormous economic importance.
They've been associated with the old culture of culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and the <unk> Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there is no place to bury the dead, or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and the <unk> communities are using this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of endangered which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption which has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for vet in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread on the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- it has a huge amount of time for <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what do you do doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a sustainable problem is not going to be at all.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise, and you can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures -- <unk> their time to spread the word <unk> the word.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed it because he saw it without effort, without running energy on the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I run and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> Ivory projects and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGOs and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
It was going to the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would <unk> it <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where we had a few Italians to teach people in country to grow food.
So we got with seed <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that drops into the <unk> River, and we teach the local to grow tomatoes Italians and <unk> and and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in interested in doing that, so they gave them to come to work -- and a few times, they didn't understand --  -- we were when the local people in the <unk> valley, they didn't have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we didn't have any of all, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
And we got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tree, in Zambia, to this size.
And we could not believe it, we were telling the <unk> look, how easy is the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, in the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only we had only got the Italians collected mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what they did the Americans, what they did the English and then see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that they gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the harm than that money has <unk>
They just read his book.
<unk> of part of an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture, like my children, "I want you a lot.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture, like my <unk>
That's why white men in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said mostly economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to have the 27 years only answering the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, but you never start anything, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give it an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, but not at <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have <unk>
So the planning has this point blind.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know the known, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face faces, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor for the company, the family family of the business -- which sets up with you in your house, at the coffee table in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this crease crap that we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to say, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
And so I got <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most excellent business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you -- you know, privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you have to come back in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What about you have to talk about this morning.
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we have fossils that are not renewable <unk> and one another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
It'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a fascinating story that I read about a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year, they got together this group of people. And we got this bunch of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would have had not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is going to continue to grow up to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses, would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City <unk>
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States emerged -- <unk> generic companies <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
One, you have to offer them <unk>
In another way, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to give them an absolute <unk> service <unk>
And then I later have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The youngest company, the most small company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can make, selling and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not not born.
We have looked at and looked at the 100 companies in the discrete world, <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one -- no one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment set up in bars in bars and their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did by this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who will ask you, what need to take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." It was going to look like <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and request more things without calling the door to a <unk>
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more hopes to the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs to be able to reflect our needs.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
There is a parade in New York -- there is a parade in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties.
I live around this house, and I thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
Their death was sudden and that was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so much.
And this was a profound gratitude for me for time and so on.
It gave it clarity things to my current life.
But I'm going to keep this in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch the day and forget what really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and he painted about it sentences for <unk> stop dying <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit on the line of changing <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to give you once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope and the hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and to remember what the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This occurred last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center, we made a kit and now they've made up on the world in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share one another.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of magnitude increasing, it is more important than ever, to find the ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
Governments is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we have to prepare for death is one of those things that will give us more power.
If you think about the death state, our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request today.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
Not speech, but it provides joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When I singing children's songs from our childhood, trying to say words of the ones that I didn't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, he pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and <unk> birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- although you wouldn't consider them within the <unk> that would only mean one thing -- which was <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual, it plays a different way from there to be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have been <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there has been some difficult moments in my family, when I would have wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens for the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you know, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> They're a <unk> Each one of us has a gift inside their inner and, frankly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, he experienced a little bit of what must have been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communications, which would give me a kind of communication to student engineering.
I was scared.  And I was really afraid.  <unk> of these students with their great minds and their great books and his great words and unknown words.
But in the developing those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell down the hole in the <unk> and saw the door to a new world.
And so I felt when I had these conversations with the students, and I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment, and if we don't know about this, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and that their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant for us.
Don't tell us just that we study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully with the <unk>
The slang is an obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as I make dumb dumb ones.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, which is everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
So one thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways of moving and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> the bullets die, and they get their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's too <unk> in the language of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if it loses a little bit, and then they will give the graphs that would lead to our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding what it was <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English guess is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century, which defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge of no matter and <unk> and that, when he won, it gets it for the mere <unk> of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the newspapers to quote the exact words of the exact <unk>
And all this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He was thrown in the London Tower and <unk> but he had enough enough to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
Didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States of America.
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a regular basis.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired of them, because this debate was going on for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives wanted Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if he did not give him or her leaving ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
president, didn't invented the title. There was already before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a trivial title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "That's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take serious with a title as ridiculous and insignificant as President <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't happen.
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the headline of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> that we keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, look like, well, it was an <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now the president of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you.
And politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changes the change much more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at a foot of <unk> in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust is hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with mechanical tools.
Like others, I wear a soft <unk> and it holds off the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
My hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> that he lost the control and dropped countless feet on that hole.
While I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep part of that hole in the deep hole their lives without earning a reward, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often, often, and often,
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're prey in slavery.
In the last 28 years I had been documenting native cultures in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Summit of <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was there in the world but not like grade.
When we end up talking to me, I was very bad at the honestly I was convinced it to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me around the stomach and a few weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
And a few of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the whole tries to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times a annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
But today we can take entire families around the entire country by <unk> <unk>
<unk> slavery generates revenues of over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promises of good education and better work to find out that they are forced to work without paid under a threat of violence -- and they cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods that are produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a <unk> temperature temperature -- men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- entire families -- the mechanically ventilated families -- brick in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
It was <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks for eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it rather <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm to it, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment for these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't know it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't afford any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not citizenship that country.
I could put it in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
As much as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> rocks for miles per <unk> terrain to the trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the kids than the children that were put in their heads on their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they are slaves and work 16 or 17 hours a day, because this has been this whole life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, they warned me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was given to me, women who had been previously <unk>
It was driven by a little stairs that would give this dirty dirty basement of light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they are local for <unk>
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children -- some of just seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number that's painted on the wall, divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse in their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a deep <unk> fear of <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows of big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we played a very difficult subject that slavery is important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in their home service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of play.
I went to Indian villages where there was entire families that had entire families put together in the trade.
This is a family book.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a step fast.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a boat, two older kids, some younger kids -- makes sense of it?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families and <unk> and they forced to work with high <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up there was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of branches in the immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and kids, and with fear, they got thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
As a fear of his love is not going to run and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> this is the youngest slaves under his command.
I met these guys at the age of five in the morning, when I went to the last networks, but they had been working on the whole thing.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with his appearance of suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
It asked us to put it on a way of land to the jungle.
And at the end of the road, we were invited to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out.
Then he pointed out this path and said, "This is the road, this is the path.
As we started back, we took the <unk> that I put up the way and after walking around an hour and after walking around an hour, I found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had a very holes in front of the holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up with their backs and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember I looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have up to 90 meters, and these people carry heavy heavy bags bags that then they will be shipped to another area in which they would take the gold to extract the gold.
The site seems to be filled with strong and strong men and <unk> but if we look more closely, the margin is to work at the least lucky ones, and also the kids.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died, his father was working with him in the mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt.
When I met her, he had worked in the <unk> 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> that the doctors were saying that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, that is forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams of being released and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, <unk> to a remote possibility -- which is inspired by respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you worldwide.
I wanted you to know that we knew that we're going to give us testimony to them, and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves with other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I'm going to think about these so many beautiful people -- beautiful people, I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you can see in people like you, and I hope that that will turn on a fire, and I hope that <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math -- and there's a peculiar problem for which we call it, we are like the management successes.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I want to try and explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We have <unk> the <unk> of the Dutch <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's like Parkinson's disease, we lose this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, in his time, it was a virtuous dancer dance.
Over the last few years has been done very much progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for the Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not biological <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam for themselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic.
So what I want to do with you as a kind of not a try, as a try, as you can see, in some sense at least all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds like <unk> we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we need -- the <unk> for example.
And how did it require an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal chords as <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're low cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it comes to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to <unk>
We can reduce our patients out of patients.
It wouldn't do not need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make a huge <unk> of low clinical trial for the first time, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's disease, you can call it low price -- and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached seven percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thanks.
What will you take out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people can not be <unk> You may not know it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that we have in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we are looking for the <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the actual markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to do a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we would take the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Okay, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March finished, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We are <unk> in the dark, in rooms with no windows and, usually, we avoid the sunlight light.
We do the thin models still more <unk> we can do the perfect skin -- we can be able to be able to be able to do the press for the press, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience, and a real taste by the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> There was <unk> in the place working as part of the feedback team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I went to <unk>
It's a little fishing village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by wave.
The level of water has achieved over 24 feet and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It turns out the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools took mud and let the house ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish and tons of dead fish out of the local <unk>
We love us and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the town.
It helped clean up the <unk> <unk> big, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that he was there, and I had the honor that that day was given to me to clean up the photos.
And this was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I moved around my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on with Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the <unk> face of the girl with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl wouldn't have the appearance of her, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they got a little bit more pictures, and it took more <unk> and it got more <unk> so I went back on with Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> an neighbor town north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporary <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. I could take a few weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using how to guide the areas that color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures ravaged by bacteria, with algae, with algae -- even with oil, all of it along with the time step of time continue to be <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless he was clean, dry and it would have been <unk> by their <unk>
We had luck with the <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As once he said, once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was really lucky in the photos.
I had started <unk> she was stopped and stopped when you realize that it was even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been able to be able to put the images into a single photo and put it into the full picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something about their history with us.
A lot of his husband found the pictures at a fire station, between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
And the day I gave him his photographs of his photographs at least <unk>
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could get back to look, something that I could remember from the past day I had not been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up with the <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up over <unk> photographs, photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them became the hands of their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 percent hundreds of photos and hundreds of photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend over <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would get to look for.
This was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection with the past.
When a photo like this comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something larger, I'll bring something bigger to it, using their talent for something that is not similar models of perfect skin.
So to conclude, I'd like to read this email -- he sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As we <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple in an exhibition for just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go for a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion people, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light moving.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, <unk> and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it on and turn it into a <unk> of a second or it is, in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do they spread out those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light on movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is happening.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a photons package that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually get to the lid and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
And at that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, after a number of pictures, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and the current <unk> and we make it go down the same distance, and we see it in the slow camera about 10 billion times, how much they think that would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually all one year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And what about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves of the table of the tomato table and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature looks like a picture, I was thinking, like, a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a broad composition of it.
But if you look at a more time you look at this tomato -- you'll notice that, as the light comes out of the tomato -- it is still bright. It wasn't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces into its interior and it goes back after a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown up without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at the MIT.
Like photographers, you know, if you take a photo at a lower exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> so I can barely go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very tight <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all these data on crude data in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can get invisible to them.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You can go into the room, a part is going to be reflecting on the gate, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works like quick, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to how distance.
When you project a laser can record a picture in gold, which you see on the screen, really doesn't have any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could make cars that are <unk> collisions with what's going on on the curve, the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light reflected off the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body with <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood and the blood is quite hard, so really, this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> to solve the problems of imagining technology in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it turned science in art, an art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we harvest is not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to see that we can be able to do it.
And create a new form of computational photograph with slow and color codes.
And let's look at those ripples -- remember, the time between each of those waves are just about <unk> a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going out of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- I would have loved to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes appear to the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
<unk> Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can actually record a song to you and get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were able to find a change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all of these people gathering that it was looking for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who from exhibiting a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and what changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent of information lines.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This organization says that every European company, every single <unk> Internet provider have to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends him a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or their <unk>
And all over Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people that came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some even said that this would be the <unk>
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany ...
And I also wondered if this works really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, then it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for favor to me, all the information they were about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't have a concrete response, it was all quantum blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, the agreement.
They would send the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
I looked at it, and I said, well, it's a massive archive.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what it means is <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Island City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom in and butt and go forward.
You can see every step I make.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one on the other, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
So this is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who he talks with, who send an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in their pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of continuing our lives and they want to deal with them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to <unk> their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value.
When you go home, you get to your psychology who just because companies and government agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you give them to remember that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> at the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, I have cerebral palsy, so let's go back all the time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
It's only a accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of the present to you.
You feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
They are at the shopping center, they are in the shopping center, you drive in a circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
I 16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I've got the <unk> and the P. <unk> is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim women, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial goal.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you be able to do it, do it <unk>
If my three older sisters I would be <unk>
If my three sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I also went, and if we didn't take all the ultimate score -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years by putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that I would get it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there is 20 Arabic and keep all of the family,  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a slogan of campaign.
The people that I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
And yet, it looked like a lot of a lot to die during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months old, and so <unk> the dawn of sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to wear <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back, so I was drinking milk on the back, and I remember the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I did yoga was a comedian of <unk> that could not stand up with <unk> <unk>
And I can now stand on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, University of Arizona, because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> it was the <unk>
I all love me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate score on my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo of my glass teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> the end will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, crying back, historically, as if somebody would have killed my cat, asking why she and she told me because they thought I could not do the venture stunts
And I said, "Well, if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and they gave it to an actress without cerebral <unk>
The university was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled papers.
As I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors not <unk> actors, with disability.
Just let perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
And in my first tour I took books from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first term that he took when he fell at the end of the first term I was at high speed on the <unk> of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East and <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival <unk> <unk> in New York City in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, and at the time you remind the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as invited to the news program by cable it has Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a graduate dance, and I went to a study and sat down on a wheelchair.
I looked at the head and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I went to the desktop of the host to not go out on the screen of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end of my opportunity I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't return to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just like the <unk> and I taped my chair.
One thing that I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or older than a child.
Suddenly, my Internet on the Internet became a <unk> object.
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do we <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite one, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it?
We should really be praying for her."
A <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
Women are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors were saying not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But having grown up with the media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet on the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children Palestinians to Palestinians Palestinians are a tiniest part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me living in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no work, no matter of the future.
He just lived in a tent, in the city outside of <unk>
And after maybe a year -- nothing.
One day I read a guy who offered him to <unk> after dinner, and <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
It gets a little money to buy new clothes -- money to send their new money to send home to his family.
They present to a young guy.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That child from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization to the Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a little boy in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came to us.
This was the first thing that got him out of what we call the <unk>
And their story is repeated around the world around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed people who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
And it's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they didn't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, the <unk> will be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being faced with that hospital <unk> thinking, and I would never have gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a lot of juveniles in a corporate basis?
They went down to 90 juvenile leaders, <unk>
We sat down and we had a ideas of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate student, <unk> frustrated, were the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the most obstacle to get to the point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who were usually couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point going to hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
Tell the young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking at so much.
And you can train young people to be <unk>
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business farming.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until he came, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from plastic from overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, sniff the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire the young, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, and working for government, but their history, their history, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurship is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to <unk> in development and put them into their business.
<unk> to young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from the conception to creation, and create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park of <unk> is how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
It gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs, and they eat their <unk> innovation and they have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace -- that <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area to the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we could -- almost could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with heart hearts with <unk> <unk> balls, and old paper balls.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was getting a little bit away.
Who's clean our <unk>
No matter as a <unk> or where you look at the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash reason for 11 tons of waste and two tons of waste and <unk> every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed to go into more <unk>
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I would <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and the <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies still keep the weight of taking over their body tons of trash all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Best <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming up and moving into traffic all day and move across around you.
They just want to be <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash of it is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about what's relentless of waste.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective form of the day, this starts to take advantage of its container and its dangers inherent in very real ways.
What we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old people, we don't have room for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger of the <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing his relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed of average every day.
So I mean just the speed of the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We don't really care about it, and we have been able to have a coffee cup or take our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, we don't forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it will take out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about garbage collection that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in a <unk> way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you do that?
And their work enables us to do our own.
They're almost a kind of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in a form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage truck and I heard the <unk> of a garbage truck on the street, I grabbed my little boy and went down the stairs, and there was a man doing his journey of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have species, we must have to account and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The city waste is what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the nation's amount of nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next to see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage -- you would have a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And in addition to the fact that the different analysis of different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example of an invitation started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because of the <unk> it generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this is not going to happen because this is a temperate weather. which is 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, its view has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little monkey <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a very large area of the city, where much of the buildings we see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs on the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every ground because of the space.
I also thought about how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of concrete with <unk> to allow the air air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
Do you have fractal geometry.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't very easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what they do.
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the center of the mall because in the end of the world there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade of facade was so much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but because it wasn't necessary because it wasn't necessary anymore.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity was short almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this sea oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is set up with water in the inside.
They're waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master master plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to just understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
So during that analysis, I was special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen years of <unk> <unk> <unk> on almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was broaden the existing streets and creating 12 initial blocks, similar blocks, the size of which there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the gates of <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little project in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density in higher levels and lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community around the space occupied by the construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and make activities like running a <unk> race for the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changing the communities and local economies at the same rate growing up buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture of simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I put it up, my sinister plan.
I was given a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the classroom, I took the book on grades.
And then, I did.
You know, <unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Like this.
All the Like --  And I set up to bring the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other teammates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a line of that, just because I would be there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt good for it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never gave up.
It's that everything was <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I get excited about the reason why I thought this little little girl, so small was so good for <unk>
Am I <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
You also primates. You are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause for spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would be able to be able to be able to see the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if it wasn't there -- I would have had no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There is no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
I would take the lists of reading from high school at high school because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of our jealousy, almost got all of them.
So this year was done by 100 years of his <unk> "In <unk> of the <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> of mine, all that we could have --  and thinking about <unk> we have the details that are <unk> right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the egos, which is reduced to the person, to their desire, their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel silly, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what details like <unk> to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> do all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure might give me pleasure to another, maybe myself."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover adds up to his collection of instruments in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You need to be <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links well by the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy, suddenly you hear behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with the real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make them seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are looking for knowledge, search for the truth, a painful truth -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful -- the more painful -- the best <unk>
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways for <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, who makes us suffer, it causes in us a much deeper range of feelings and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion that we have asked us, our <unk> our <unk> ambition and our <unk>
You have any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
And one day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was being consumed with the idea that her woman was going to get it.
And Freud said that there was something bizarre about that man, which was not <unk> what his wife was doing.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well, how do we get them to look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we became a <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself as the age of eight years -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years old, was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since the one that would send <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, it was all a year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend. I have to confess that when I was this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big, even though it comes to creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or wanting what you have to take out of your being and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the ground floor, you have your rings, it takes your rings, a cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the whole world, as well as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times.
We live at times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
novels show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the Oscar <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it tells him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> on each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once in the <unk> of the Six <unk> once they go back to <unk> and he goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't like to raise your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem with geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being he <unk>
Could it still be that simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And watch what <unk> the <unk> <unk> the terrifying thing I took <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped on the spelling module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the gray gray -- it was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the majority of peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a couple of 400,000 people, and he asked the collaboration with 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
<unk> people, including the <unk> crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which Aldrin went on after Armstrong <unk> last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Some people ask, why do we <unk>
So why do it turn our goal?
And they might also ask, why scale the mountain more <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why do you play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
And we chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they are <unk> but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> was not just a victory of the West -- about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the <unk> of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long line of technology <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin, and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and the <unk> of smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970, I called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle <unk> but in 1969, the crew crew <unk> flew at 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one traveled faster than the <unk> crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of the power of the technology has been <unk> when we see the power of the technology that we think was going to be able to go to Mars, to create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population, seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube from the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission -- but I was totally sure that I would have been seeing the colonies on Mars.
So that has occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like if the technologists had <unk> and they had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> and social networks, or the algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for <unk> in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years when I was <unk> Microsoft, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, the incentives that the venture capitalists offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley, he says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to deal with the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly what goes wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak point without worrying about the risk, they preferred little investments on the ones they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital of the development and development that are long-term capital, also not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems, because they don't have a commercial value value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we cannot solve the big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global consumption of energy comes from renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, technologists, of the entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy development, a significant increase in the research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy -- or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the great problems that seem technological, they may not be.
We know for time that famines are the result of failure in the food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are <unk> policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems, sometimes we have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war in 1971, but we suddenly found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer types, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must be willing to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it is true with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, is a very general belief.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that could have risen on others.
I don't have of course.
But I can turn to the opinion surveys and surveys of opinion are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there aren't many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago still be quite <unk> the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway over.
But is this evidence enough?
What the record polls are, of course, opinions are.
What else can we <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes, that people plays out when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody came to you, <unk> in the <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
I would probably be asked by asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust in a <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel like a kind of <unk> officer or a guy in a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secrecy.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they are trying to make the good judgment for the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
I think it's a stupid goal.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I would argue to have more trust in what is <unk> but not what it is.
In short, I'm <unk> I don't trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are going to take their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it, he says, yes, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about making a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the raw raw matter, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be <unk>
But yeah, on the contrary, they're not responsible for them we could trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they are <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very excited to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're talking about before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in our public life, and we have to argue that the system of accountability is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they do the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you have similar examples.
Let's get all over that, by the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we're going to be worthy of trust of trust and <unk> to the people that we are trustworthy and if we were able to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple <unk> <unk> <unk> which doesn't do <unk>
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately is <unk> because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You've got to give you the bases enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you cannot be <unk> by all the people, all the time.
But you also have to make evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do we do that?
That one is a day in all parts, and they do the common people, the <unk> the <unk> very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- he says I can be able to do it without giving us explanations anymore.
I take it back and turn it back to me for the color of the color I want.
That's <unk> I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to do.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've come to be <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly increasingly more and more and more, to a point that today, it's less than one millimeter, the thickness of the <unk> and power power has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that gets deeper into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers their physical body to the pixel
Designers can match their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the booms.
But the two hands remain outside the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
They took a transparent bombsight with the chambers of depth to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in the real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and try to highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there is on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
We would have a lot of us we would have bought and moved things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them physics so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel here.
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D frame in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did is we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And by programming the object, the object, we released it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically, physically and at the distance, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality, sometimes we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike <unk> or text, and this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what is most fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information is not just going to show us something but to begin to act on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to deal with our world.
So we started talking today about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a underlying path toward the <unk> a safe way to <unk>
No matter whether I would like it or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer company.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I just wrote to the director of the school in the head of a radio show.
But no adult <unk> <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends would tell me, but they were kids, with no authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much higher to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved for another <unk>
No one to me just wanted to <unk> Okay.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that were here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange as well.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your <unk>
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> cap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map was out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never wondered that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and <unk> literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the scholars a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in the life of life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and politics and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> -- Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of getting lost in the translation, found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of the translation I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel I used or powerless or <unk>
Having a dream -- a <unk> dream is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I have come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that I come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken sleep, you can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always are <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> sky threw himself on the couch, of my office and taken off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
And with the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> was made me easy to move the head while you get the solution.
"The <unk> new <unk> said Alex, and so that she was right.
You start working later, you start to work after, you have kids later, even the death goes next.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to stop.
But shortly after that, my squad <unk> pushed me to press to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, is coming out with guys underneath his category it was <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get away with the next.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they got in, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of benign recklessness. was a real problem and had real consequences, not only Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the future and the future of <unk> the future <unk>
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one gets to the age of age, without going to go before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> I want a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give you a way to your life when you have 30 and <unk>
People in more of 40, I don't trained in panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that over half the Americans are married, or they are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that wants to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility goes to their top of 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact <unk> on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear as often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence
<unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not going on.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart, smart, interesting men like you or their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not just killing each other, I'm killing each other.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show.
I was better training the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30s, it turned the music and everyone started to sit on.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit of a bit of end, but it won't be <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge amount of pressure on the '50s and so many of the start a career, to choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The midlife media crisis is not about buying cars, red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
You know that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves in the room, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What I was doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or entertainment, but it still couldn't be married, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though they could live very difficult -- very difficult -- his previous life had been even harder.
It was often <unk> in our <unk> but then she would wake up in the say, "You don't choose his family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she took her head on his legs and he cried for nearly the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words in case of <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of me if she gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I worked with Alex as the <unk> <unk> of Emma going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or wife, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that I was aware of that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For identity capital, I mean to do something which is add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital capital, identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to give it to you.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I am <unk> the exploration that I should not tell you, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you the airport, but the <unk> that you put together with friends with some similar minds just to who you know what you know, how you think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new business piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes out of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call <unk> <unk> your friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have jobs.
But the other half -- no, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is a way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed you don't pick your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as an <unk> Emma would soon give her family when they have a mate and it exists his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit than the 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person who you live right now or get away when everyone on Facebook starts to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so <unk> in love as you are at work.
You know, your family must be an conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with anyone else to get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a prime who worked at a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped it get a job there.
That supply work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend with which he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special <unk> events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I sent me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency crisis are not enough enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the airport in Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, the 21 or the 25 and the 25 and even <unk> a good day, a good job -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea worthy of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have now the privilege of saying to <unk> how every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, get identity, use identity, use their identity -- they get their family, pick your family.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them math mathematics in the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I took tests and test tests and evidence.
I give you assignments.
When I work back, I would get grades.
What I called my attention was that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was really convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time for time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a very psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it better.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy <unk>
We tried to predict how to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would take away in the competition.
We studied professors who are working in the very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of the learning learning results.
We teamed up with private companies, asking ourselves, what about these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good <unk> the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the week, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination <unk> and then waited for about more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security that they felt about children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little it knows about the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related or even related to the measurements of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to do with the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, and we have to be willing to fail, and to start everything back with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
So since that time, I was going to get away by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic education.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read carbon signals, enough to read the basic idea of the web pages or the paper.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a <unk> person in both sides, as if I was screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe that it's the other way. It's what it works.
This is a tree.
tree. tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are a <unk>
If you put your arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- <unk> -- because a tree loudspeaker is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two walks together, it's very hot.
Three walks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the gate, you ask questions.
<unk> touched there is someone at home?
This person is coming out of the front of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three women together have care is <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build some other 32.
So with each small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started making a sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun.
This is a sun on the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two stacked mountains one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> to their enemies politicians beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it is a <unk>
This is a slide for remind you that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The movie has been his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave it a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic bullet.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial <unk> of child fantasy show.
However, the Oz magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
And the trend really took <unk> years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> boy would give a girl dressed as the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of great differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician magician.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz magician do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the military of the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing to the Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see Star Wars and my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the media level had <unk>  And so slid in the room and sat down in the room and sat down in the room and sat down on the back and I don't think he understood what was going on, but it was going to get rid of it all.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> resilience and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke was one to <unk> the government?
This is <unk> with the magician of the <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your film?
And we do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up with, right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
So why is there so much capital capital in the movies for our kids, and so little of the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this <unk>
I know that the princess <unk> it doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected that the credit to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why do they stay there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and I will stand up to the Disney of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, kids are not really their goal.
They make a phenomenal job in teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend their <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues to occur in classic <unk> each one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
And so far, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you, it's available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has no roots and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a conversation about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the boy who both like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see this in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a Hollywood film film is.
<unk> doesn't happen the <unk> test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a <unk> where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the challenges to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular films, how many of them believe they have actors that have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one of every five women says that it has been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think about is that there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then collecting the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to be able to <unk>
We have tools in our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> -- but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children males -- a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what it is.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and you love to share their knowledge with other people to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and fight just and more stories where their work looked like their work is to join a team -- maybe a team that was led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for sea fortune on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
But over time, I got to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my eyes wasn't enough.
Because, anyway, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up at about 1,300 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up in the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and do a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using infrared color, suddenly the place you see as a brilliant <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the <unk> of the caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an old city of the old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Roman Empire.
The place is places in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire. There was this great revival of the old art of the ancient art and architecture and religion.
The <unk> always have known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside red circles, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, The Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find out that randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area just slightly high that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians of Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of the sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for the human occupation of it.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> layer of a number of hundreds of years that date from the Empire population, exactly the same period as we think we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, of the Roman Empire.
So, we have a dense <unk> layer that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry, which shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but let's get to the place in the near future for <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire. It was probably written in <unk> four years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the most of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as TED -- TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas were really started in 1984 B.C. to a missing city not much time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the <unk> for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
So I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> house.
I'd like to give you attention to the color of the gate, the material that is made.
So now we <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing in a <unk> <unk> and they are in the direction of their <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, are <unk> they're going <unk>
And they collide in front of their house.
There are bikes flying around the parts, and they go on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the gate,
So when you go down to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
They can feel your <unk> blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you go on to get into the mouth of your mouth.
They went on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing, dancing about her center, singing <unk> -- singing <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick road and from the oven coming up to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len was the Wizard of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping around.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
It will take the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
There were entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize it in the top of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked her, "You know, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using a few ancient techniques invented by a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their speeches -- and that the <unk> academic used to memorize books in Greece, and the <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, but a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a guy named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad I didn't even remember it had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory is doing that we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he was based on the <unk> paper in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk>
And when I come back, I read a lot of treaties about the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having <unk> and disciplined and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would argue that they have changed as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined <unk> memory and <unk> this competition is so unique of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this across the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory, in the lab.
They wanted to know that it has some brains in some different structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> MRI machine, you know, your brains while you have numbers -- faces and forms of flakes of snow, they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different than others.
They were actually <unk> or they looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is managing as an armed race in where someone is going on with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
And I desk, it in front of him, there's 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> that he's about to try and memorize it in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits -- <unk>
Within half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques by the end of the end, it's reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> he says this: I tell two people to remember the same word -- I say to you, <unk> that there is a guy named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you have a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you, I asked that word that I told you about a <unk>
What do you <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that you dance on your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
I'm probably going to get some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is about two years ago in the <unk> Greece ago.
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says, there was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up standing up, and he <unk> his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> hall.
We get to all of us.
But not only killed all of them, but it shattered the bodies to be <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they wouldn't be <unk> the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting next to me.
It took the family of the <unk> to where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you let me tell me that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to make them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet I could tell you that if you tell them to say who I was sitting on on the horse shot in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do this memory, in the same way that I would have done it -- if you had invited me to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your home, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they walked out in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help them remember it.
So it's like <unk> <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in their own memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a lot of hard about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting in <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing about it is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in the place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school dropout bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never expect you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is improve the ability to improve the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> security articles leave with tape -- just two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could be able to put in a sort of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Now, it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers on the phone, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize it from <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basics, we remember when we pay attention.
So let's get it up when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We have a kind of deep processing kind of processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> over there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is, in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to us, we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about how to process <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the guy who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so you can just give it a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am out of it, and I was a <unk> <unk> I was living in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom of a kid.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony who gave the living room.
And there everybody passed the <unk> so every time I went from my room to the bathroom -- every time I looked at me, and every time I went back, and I came back in a towel -- everybody looked at me.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> not <unk> and I hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I feel, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of zones, but of those of those emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Music determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what they think about being based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that use the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build homes.
You see, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's <unk> it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library. which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing -- it has this round thing -- a beautiful thing --  -- that <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the <unk> the <unk>
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, he ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we used the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new new technologies -- new solutions for life forms today.
We would sort of give it to us and we made it so much that we get away from the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and go back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experiment with them, we can swing the <unk> <unk> over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Very hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started engaging those symbols.
It is <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
And we added <unk> and we added a bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it <unk>
We take <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up with the size of buildings.
nuts.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies with.
Those fantasies could be the <unk> of French or the French.
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we think of some of the other places.
I know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques to computer -- and we find new <unk> a few ways that are engaged in other ways.
This is an academic, and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something is <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of these rare moments when critical and public and public and public and public people were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up with a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Chicago, New York, New York, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we very quickly learned that these shapes and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the main mayors of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium, with other individual architects.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can take a boat, a plane, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, which means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It wasn't very accurate enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before knowing if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture since the <unk> of steel or steel or an elevator.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, and it starts to swing the media, and it starts to swing it faster and faster, and to be on both extremes -- almost <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you know, the public.
We can now make symbols of a lot of <unk> with emotional payload, -- something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation community.
But that meant that two years before it ended the building, it was already part of the community -- and like the pictures looked exactly the way it was, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and share it in the social media, the building left to be just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that does it do with the collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think of a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead to the mayor of <unk> people and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave that by architecture.
That means the <unk> <unk> is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find the right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with a database of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings are going to be <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for sports or to <unk> or you can even marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream in the East <unk> of New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community tied together around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more friendly.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings don't just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most unequal spaces, local libraries of households where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in the very cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> like their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he asked me to think, "When do you stop doing this?
How do we suddenly do not taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's kind of confused because, even though his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And what his mom says and what his friends, or classmates say, "You don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk> "I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and effective teenager, which gets these answers on one of the stages of their life more emotionally emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is driving to do this?
Well, teens are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like a feast in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected; is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of liking that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is being sent to digitally.
What is the most <unk> in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are <unk> from the news of the <unk>
<unk> zero remain <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are comparing of.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sports stars and the singers of <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be very <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as the way to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five are not attending at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you can see it well, specifically if you don't believe that you're sufficiently <unk> -- you know, a lower score on the average of your teammates who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, America and China, has been made.
And it gives you regardless of what these young people actually weigh in.
So to make it good of course, we're talking about you as you see you not really how you're really really.
The <unk> over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
The teenagers with a little bit less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they're engaged in more diet they can't take you into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drug drugs, diet -- <unk> <unk> aesthetic relationships to earlier ages and no protection and harm damage.
The perfect search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe that they have overweight again, regardless of whether or not have any greater <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel secure with the way they can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that happen?"
It will make this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we must make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are really crucial points for anybody willing to provide a education in body self-worth that works.
A education is <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
I'm challenging the status of the way that women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our <unk> in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing it by assuming the responsibility for the type of images and feedback that we published in our social networks.
Can we get them to people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow all their to the entire person, valuing the <unk> the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see that they will never be <unk> of being those who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are you in mind?
Your <unk>
Your <unk>
Your <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two miles away -- what would it mean for her if I was liberated from that <unk> voice, which was <unk> for not having legs long, <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would she mean for her if we had to do this, and we would say to their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> to everyone.
But we get to our children the truth.
The way you look at it is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because they make us feel.
It will come to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of a year of today, becoming an insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> was initially said to him as innocent but being prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
So luckily, those plans was <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape it.
Later on, it would be convicted of his involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being able to be an investigative engineer, with a <unk> American mother, high school -- the two did every possible for giving me happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims, most Muslims, getting to meet.
By the experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to want the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible means for everybody to live as them.
A few months before he was arrest him and explained to me and explained to me that in the last weekends he and a few friends, had been going to shoot on <unk> Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was going to get it by the FBI.
When I touched my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot shot at the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others, and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such child.
But the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what it seemed so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could be <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the northern parking parking lot of the northern tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone was now time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class as often as a <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white but to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it very <unk> for growing under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I'm <unk> by opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put in trial my way to think, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was engaged in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys we had done friendship, was Jewish age.
And I took several days to go out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that the whole life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a <unk> a sense of empathy toward the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what the homosexual thing is, but I know what is to be tested for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
So every night, Jon Stewart made me be honest about my <unk> and I was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my figure out <unk> at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
At times, the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my own life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put in a <unk>
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, which is to try to take my story to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, and their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak against these acts of sense, like rejection of my father.
So with this <unk> I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that the children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.
At this point, there is a film that was projects in their minds.
It's an amazing <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound from what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your starvation, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, like a childhood moments that project into your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience all of it in straightforward.
This film is your stream of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film for you, you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have a good thing.
I'm not sure that you are aware of it.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that <unk> what we got to produce results without experiencing the film <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
Science for nature, is objective for nature.
<unk> for nature, is critical.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, and neuroscience is going to studied the brain -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science, the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations until the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that triggered Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you, by saying that this kind of work in neuroscience is that we want some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what would be <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
It doesn't tackle the real <unk> of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it there is an internal movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find an <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do we work the <unk> how the <unk> how are the <unk> how are the <unk> how are the <unk> how are they <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- all are questions about how the goal works.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we are talking about, how we talk, how we talk to them, how we talk to them, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the difficult problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still hasn't much to say.
I'm a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works for a long time, hitting the wall against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in <unk> physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand up at this point.
We have a very cool string of explanations -- great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy to be able to deal with consciousness in a scientific fashion.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the real subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the <unk> brain behaviors and this is what it takes is everything that needs an explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of the most basic terms.
On the contrary, they're considered principles, and there is the world.
Sometimes, the list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the phenomena in terms of the fundamental concepts -- <unk> space, time, mass laws, so I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and I applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find out with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space, time, mass, charge for a matter of logic on the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the consciousness itself as a <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it was suddenly not the object of science.
It opens up the way to create scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the <unk> <unk>
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when he thinks -- "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, it's not.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of the raw feeling -- sort of <unk> some systematic precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human, <unk> <unk>
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And I am supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a different degree of information, but just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration, it's smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different standard of consciousness from zero.
It actually brings a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness of the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
So from <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
In this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> <unk> has the potential to address our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I wasn't supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to be thinking, well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk> movie.
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- they have a fairly serious ethical problems about the ethic.
Finally, you can ask for our collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk -- at this point, we have a collective consciousness -- this is an internal film for this full group of TED -- different than the internal movies about each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that's at least a question that must be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a very fundamental thing, than the second one that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a serious consciousness theory.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will ultimately go to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an underwater profile.
I went to school, I went to my friends, my friends, my little sisters.
It was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to get it to a community prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is an obvious problem.
She hasn't gotten nothing."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we took the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching school in a <unk> high school school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the classroom at 11 studies, a boy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What's <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law law for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability with disability as an inspiration.
And we are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for a lot of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I'm going to do what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for them. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to be <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you were lied to a disability.
Yes, they have been sold the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not bad and it doesn't make it <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> stopped <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl with no hands drawing with a pen <unk>
You may have seen a child running with <unk> carbon legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn porn term for a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
And so in this case, let's go to the disability in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we could see them and think, "Well, by very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been dealing with strange <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stand up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people with no disability.
You're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
Let's get a few things.
But the things that we <unk> aren't the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> which is deliberately because it was called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to pull out the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the ordinary.
They simply are using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it does.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "Oh my God, you're not at least inspired by anything?"
And I really know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability in all time.
And yet, I don't know that I am lucky, that they are.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall to me --  -- <unk> the kind of trick that you can carry on the cell phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles faced a load of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> to the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude turning all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> not for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be able to get away from the bed and remember our names at the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade in a middle school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and a professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happens because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running for the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man of 110 pounds, <unk> us trying to deal with all of its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine up up the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment ago, a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> at the football field from the perspective of <unk>
You've got to realize that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players -- and I have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get rid of it, how we took it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not a cheap one.
And I'm going to show you why this video video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God, Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a <unk> rollercoaster in his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball on the bottom of the network? Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's only virtual reality.
How do we achieve the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the <unk> and the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a brief review about technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> in their field <unk> so he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I put <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to his group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
And by memorize the strategy.
They just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing games.
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game in real time.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera in every street corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people in the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad people will have <unk>
This is <unk> to the good teams of the bad.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being alone.
It will also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
What would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the field <unk>
Let's get the ball up and <unk>
<unk> to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left on the left of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to kill you, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
We get to the protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there is an open disorder.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you land -- but the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights and your career.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and fans have been following it from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to do a lot of people in it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how corrosive is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it true for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more about space and science rather than <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do and the decisions we take and the challenges that we face is <unk> like always, from us.
Thank you.
I was just <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- I was going to see me the south end of the <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its excellent architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> who Joseph <unk> engineer head <unk> said that, "The bridge is basically <unk>
Spider suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more of 1,600 people have jumped from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take them to the other dimension, and this bridge has been <unk> as such, so each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is <unk> bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
Those who don't believe in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize the <unk> of death to the fact that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for about two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young year was talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
So let's get the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, the officials as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, official veterans are trained to the new offices.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 of Julius last year when they receive a call for a possible suicide bomber sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I noticed Jason talking to Jason by the Golden Gate officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created to <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of crap against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> he leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind and smart kid in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parent of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how he was.
The parents of Jason had they <unk>
Spider damage affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What is <unk>
What do you say?
And in my experience, it's not only to talk, but that you have to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or you say to the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know it.
You just stand there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their lives, you've had these <unk>
<unk> to the person in front of it can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his card.
She lost his son the 19 of January 19 year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never came there.
I called the police police and <unk> as the disappeared night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much to fight for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering a real mental disease.
It should be so easy to end it with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his child took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call for a potential suicide bomber on the bridge near the north.
<unk> my bike. I watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, the <unk> immediately <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half an hour, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane and give her life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out to it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What did he have done to <unk> and gave it to the hope and the life another <unk>
You know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mom, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to be <unk>
"Dear <unk> Nothing erase the events of the 11 of March, and you are one of the reasons Kevin still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we know what we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
I was really paying for you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of it, she writing, <unk> when I visited the General Hospital of San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I knew I had to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
He talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk>
That act, despite finishing their own pain, theft, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people in <unk> or those who think about suicide would not think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain to be <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: to sleep, drug drugs or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls suicide around the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly involved involved and just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
And for that time, I took my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one you leave on the side, the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be striving for.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and you know what you are, and a question: How do you get on that?
I must be something unique in that way, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had actually achieved the dream that I had had since a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth with my inner truth.
For reasons for reasons for the ones that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, you know, it was going to be able to do it -- <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just getting started.
We all become our families, our religion, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the <unk> beliefs or the beliefs around us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called epiphany.
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom said, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never invited to share my story, not because it thought to be what I'm bad, but how the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who told me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk>
There's a <unk> goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a beauty of beauty beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you engaged in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, and he won a <unk> and he was third three candidate in the <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, it was within the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was in queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
And in 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that passed my request out of the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "Do you know that if you gave the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested it was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was engaged in Thailand at age 19.
And it's funny that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to get surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver license with the name of the name of <unk> and <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to drive a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was going to be living his truth, but <unk> put it end to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this scenario because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood up in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep in living my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best for helping others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there's no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> All right, first to thank all my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I attended young women who have been <unk> and a few times, when they called me and a few times, when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't take his phone, he would take my mom and he would say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work -- some of it doesn't. It's just no gender, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that some times that task didn't block, and that should have a space that allowed people to come, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, and <unk>
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
And I should have room for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very exciting, <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents generally know them for their kids, but I am one of the few parents on his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts was <unk> the National Prize <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you were born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not for his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood next day, she gives her <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother would be <unk> a lot of a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, <unk> gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he went to his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only have the breast mother, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it comes in, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, they stay home and school will be held in their siblings.
Even the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he is prohibit to come out of their home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his siblings and his family, and if you would take the code of that of course honor, the could even kill you.
And it's interesting that this of the honor code, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the sentence.
And there's a more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embrace the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't want.
If <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious circle goes on and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was born, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter for her.
But when I came up, everyone was men, and I took my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came up, when she was four and a half years old and a half, I read it in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?"
Yes, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for a young event for life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One point to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, and they would be <unk> the form of a Canadian species, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that the courage to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> it on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> and sisters, brothers and sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomena.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of involvement in all of <unk> economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you speak for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised up on the right to education.
He wrote a daily newspaper to the blog of the BBC, he was offered the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> like a <unk> worldwide.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine of October 2012, the <unk> was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would take him to the ear of my wife -- "I must be <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't freak out.
Let's get the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the <unk> because of the peace of peace, and because of education, and your daughter inspired you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words would be very excited about me, and I didn't get back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains and heavy pains, because his facial nerve was cut out, I used to see a dark shadow that was going into the face of my wife's face.
But my daughter would never get off.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and <unk> on my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please don't get up.
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the most difficult moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women, is like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you didn't end his task.
You fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain for 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, done before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still just like intelligent or not?
If you're not going to be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of <unk> and <unk> and trying to get it to life for life.
I've been saved by a little bit of time.
But luckily, I have <unk> soul for what I decided to go on to try and get the killer dose, because it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with a different <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how little changes in the dose, drastically <unk> my <unk> my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a lot and chemical doses for a man, and I was shocked to see how to look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to <unk> Since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do to that to adjust those hormones and those neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my understanding of ideas.
<unk> thinking about all of pictures, and that became the key <unk> and that became the key <unk> how to make these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works the mind. It is simple: to most of us, the mental images are fundamental for thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use your imagination just to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music from his head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like the way people creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, functional MRI imaging to represent the brain. Here you see the brain scanning done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The <unk> column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left on the left. Is that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab in Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of video videos as well as <unk> their brains to create a big set of reactions to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as long as you were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information about the scan of the scan of it, to show the thing that the person was looking at.
You can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're good at doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This is done with the <unk> scanning systems, available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I can't give you that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection through images -- even me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- first we must ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger, but at this point, <unk> magnets just offered little improvements on the resolution, it doesn't increase for thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> magnets better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
But most of the advances in the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, including magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the frequencies of frequencies processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can get into a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers of growing our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few more options to open this door.
Anyway, pick a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about leaving your closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His <unk> may be telling someone else for the first time that he loves it, or telling someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you actually put in your life.
And so I all take this is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of the city, and I worked on a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I asked my head to myself, I would usually ask a child to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would have found a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it was <unk>
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence but this time I was now prepared and I was about to get out of the female issues on the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk> quotes <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues"
And so I took a deep breath, and I went down and my backs -- a <unk> girl with a little pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you kid or <unk>
And so I took it up to a long time again, and I put it up close to it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is true.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and he looked at clothes, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl with a <unk> pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it, just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> which <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as a lot of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how one feels like a closet.
It's like my closet it's not different from yours or yours or yours.
Let me give you a hundred reasons for why they go out of my closet it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> the hard thing is not <unk>
It's hard to be hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared banking on banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder to tell your child of five years you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, only is it hard.
We must stop to classify what is difficult to make it difficult for the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a <unk> it's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine myself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian <unk> to fight any child at four years that would put in the coffee.
I was frozen by fear of my dark closet in a street corner of my dark closet -- my grenade gay, and the move just a muscle is the most scary thing to ever do.
My family, my friends, full strange life that I have spent my entire life trying to get out of it, and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of the more memorable grenade was on my sister wedding.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> lady and <unk> I walked around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents' friends, people I knew I was going to do years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite show, Will Grace think?
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for me to show desperately his support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using weekends to me.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else do you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you would <unk>
That's how hard the hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of all it is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have armor <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can go out safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of how the intelligence has seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a submarine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let me step back.
So let's start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes on Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that you don't know about this, that you don't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that will <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be very carefully honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing universal states that are <unk> the diversity of the future.
Finally, in the training of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked all of these different issues. There's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a physical force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep it open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the astonishing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> investigations in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> for their life should have tendency to be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy entropy in any system that you can find in.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games, and even winning money -- actions, everything without being done with that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> foot, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided for their account <unk>
This ability to balance is have applications for robotics applications and human technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling ends of extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, and we see that <unk> can perform a version of the task model.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic development and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the network right connected to.
This is the same capacity as a network capacity -- it also has applications in healthcare, and energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering it with success and using the Panama Canal to broaden the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense of crime, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> they spontaneously found and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk> and successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management is going to have a lot of applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools -- walking upright <unk> and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were looking at smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion to it.
The machines are going on against us.
One of the major consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion that we see in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then they try and take over the world.
It's all right, that the impulse to take control of all the possible future possible is a fundamental principle than the intelligence that general intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control rather than being the way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
I'm often asking you, how do you look for targets we can learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of helping them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which is that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the dim <unk> intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will get us.
The data collected by Kepler showed the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own fake.
At the same time, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are <unk>
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of that we can potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest one.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for all of us for millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on the global scale of the world are rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist, no <unk>
And that I study the <unk> of the <unk> planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet newly discovered and the planets that we know better -- the ones in our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, demonstrated this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, partly why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
And the satellites that <unk> them as the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they're trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business is now giving not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and ideas -- compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still have to be able to be able to see places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth the air is fresh and full oxygen oxygen by our forests of tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that we have Mars waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like to do with you, I am in deep exploration with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will actually have place later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration -- and the aid goals are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to figure out and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They just find it closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the land, we may be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, Enrico Fermi physicist asked asked the fact that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations are becoming advanced enough to keep living in living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that are going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of course, will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to introduce the living environments to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the <unk> task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went back my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other gates and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get away, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I had my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> <unk> but sure that it wasn't more expensive than a <unk> at a half night -- so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, so well over.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate -- and they will ignore the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that could be done, which would be able to put in place, which was going to be going to be going to be going on.
Or at least if bad things happen, which is going to be the probability of a total catastrophe here.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> and a little embarrassed I talked about that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing with something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this about a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what came out wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try and figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to avoid that things going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you get a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds common meaning and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish places the <unk> trees -- where the tribes are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car glasses and <unk>
So at home it <unk> a place for keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, it's a particular drawer for it.
For their reading, a <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and you are <unk> with it all of your things always will be there when you <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a cell phone photo a photo of your credit card license, your credit card license to email itself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your return.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, that we will have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be dear to helping them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making, to make medical decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease attack, heart attack.
So you are thinking that having high cholesterol is the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and even you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for the most physicians that most physicians don't want to talk about and drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to stand on surgery in any medical procedure before it helps one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor of the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault about the scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat the most widely <unk> what believe it is?
How many people have to take it before they help someone person?
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke, or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of your <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you must ask for a more statistical statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Okay?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the pill -- right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 -- that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out <unk> by the drug that helps you help the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say that they must have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethic requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to deal with is quite typical.
To the surgery that is more done in the top of the age of 50, the number necessary cancer, the number needed to deal with is <unk>
That's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have luck, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of the questions before the questions that you can argue that you would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of a great choice, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change from the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a predator -- it's not necessary for the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly. You could get the lunch lunch -- so none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window through those moments of stress is the false thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown me.
So we need to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future as those <unk> could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things going on in the first place.
<unk> at night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination next to the gate, with a key to the gate of the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I will never get to a full silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade of the 1800s, and the step of the time, he mixed with local signs and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following them out of their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people faces.
So I've learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure <unk> the covered in the <unk>
This is all I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound, about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
He will go ahead and go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to do this with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic operation there.
Before this time, he had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It goes to me more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property property and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me at the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> the social hierarchy.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could tell me.
I chose I <unk>
There is a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel like I could be <unk> at <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound as my new art medium -- <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and expressing on the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the <unk>
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano, so you understand better how it works the <unk>
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is divide in many different <unk> parameters,
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the speed, like the facial expression, the speed, the speed, the speed, the speed, the <unk> the shape of the piano, the English is a linear, a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a key at once.
But the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a way to express a concept of a concept or an idea of <unk>
If only one button would change the chord -- it would create a completely different means.
The same thing happens with music in the <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal on that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
"Did it happen.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and it is used.
This is <unk>
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time in <unk> and how the distance in the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times per <unk>
But when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I would automatically be able to start in <unk>
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> left hand.
We have <unk> through the head and chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both in the head like my chest, just like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third is please get back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically does not have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow us to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> and not to learn to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like to have the same experience.
I would like to get you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you be able to do everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom. It involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up the others.
The time in the country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, and we have been coming out with these large pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it takes an eternity and it's very expensive -- and it's also very risky to use those enormous <unk>
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it with my students.
My job is to try and take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
So through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would be very excited about the robots.
Then we create what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned off light cameras and web cameras on accessories and put it on a floating robot that will move slowly by water and by plastic that we have there, and this is the picture picture by the robot.
We see these pieces of plastic floating down through the sensor while the computer on board and process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for the inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would give it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local and <unk> problem, they're trying to solve it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very enlightened kids.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they get <unk> with this two.
A child, perhaps lower than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is going on, the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil is also brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> different -- what can help to identify what there is in the water.
So let's take this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other kids.
I'm able to investigate a problem at <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away -- maybe to address a harder problem -- and also to me.
I am half Japanese and a French half and you probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, as the reports on the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the most of the time, it has to be safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and research research, with other scientists, the land, the river, the river, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of masks different.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> their entire life.
Along with them we discussed the <unk> data, that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, strategies, <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> in order to represent real-time data for <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so we could notice that the radioactive dust will come down from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But in the basis of this we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear power, and with the fishermen help we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and we built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should go the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a very small time, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with metal wood, chemistry, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, of optical lens, you can actually build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We ask things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair in new self-driving cars.
The plastic and the oil and the <unk> are <unk> <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, <unk> must prepare for the next generation to be cared for the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces on the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic is.
One is a <unk> on the environment, the other thing would be.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the Manhattan <unk> he saw a figure that is fighting to be free.
<unk> was only a tool for Miguel angel.
But life is not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information that we needed for every cell to work and for the <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production of mass.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the concepts of designers and architect trained to think their objects like <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is <unk> with little <unk>
One acts of course, as a filter, the other primarily like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that reflects its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here is a split screen that represents my view of the world that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and the gene between the <unk> and the gene, of the machine and the organism between the machine and the organism between the assembly and the growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere -- analysis and a lawyer, is shown in the two screens after me.
My job at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment where they bring four disciplines that offers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a scale of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base that some day not very far printing buildings and <unk> buildings, made of genetically modified microorganisms <unk> which glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the old Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is just the size of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're <unk> it's like a second skin made from one single piece, <unk> in flexible <unk>
Along with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we printed this layer and 3D skirt with the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines raw materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution.
That designers have access to this high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural space, and also that absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator went back to nature for <unk> and in designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We have this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not by addition of addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts of nature?
I didn't raised in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she was <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree with <unk>
For that first <unk> tree would have no difference between trunk, branches, <unk> and <unk>
The tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world in the world.
I often ask myself, "What would the design if the objects were made of one <unk>
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material -- the kind of material of the tree and the kind of fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced by organisms like shrimp, or crabs and <unk>
We thought that if we can tune their property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of seed husks the <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
It <unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, <unk> and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the material about the march and create these structures made of a single <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable <unk>
When the pieces are <unk> it leaves them in order to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the air process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with the mesh -- and if it broadens even more, on windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made from shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life and placed in the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The <unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just rather than <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological expectancy within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothing, they were <unk> two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other burning sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, not natural selection.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the tract tract -- that will help you have these bacteria and that you can bring up their function as well.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, to make the properties of material as the functionality as the functionality itself.
If we wanted more <unk> more transparent channels.
This top-down system is <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it spans 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are average creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, we get the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
And to do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material out.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
So this cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of a home in which it is <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, we put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of the silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
And yet, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch not within a box, we realized that you would take a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different across different environments, and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the brutal silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that the silk worms, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- to the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We had <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to deal with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and it was right.
And the biological silk of the <unk> silk is <unk> they give all this <unk>
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious <unk> this is also the length of the route of silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a ecology.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
This is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that takes us from a design inspired by nature inspired by a nature inspired by design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can take it with your fingers.
Three. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, what do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and developed websites -- there was the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of, you know, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, which is totally different, and I'm going to be excited about it, and I'm going to give me <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And eventually, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was troubled that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for not <unk>
I was concerned to have fear of engagement, or being stored or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have ever raised then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the significance of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they were talking about the culture.
So you ask you first what you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was talking about?
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers to the kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or I want to be <unk>
We have the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done for us over and over again as we grow in various forms, and we have a high school group to be asked by high school students who go to the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what we take away the dream.
Why?
Now, if this issue is inspired by children to dream, what might be, I'm not inspired by dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the other thing, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, but if you're good <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of destiny.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can do the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You have any term you like or you can <unk> your own.
I think it seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned talking about with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualizing data, trips and design, and I started to make <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their computer -- can be able to get a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and independent <unk>
As a little girl pianist would give them an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she is the fastest <unk>
Before I became a writer -- <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the most fine mechanics when he was starting their practices and this ability to write that compelling launches for the editors.
I rarely rarely have a loss of time to get to what you would give you even if you end up with the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. It's to say, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes <unk> others, a web designer -- sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes it turns out James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Company defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> which are themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing bad about you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get out of a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep in and put ideas, and <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we have to deal with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them will be told that they're just more like their fellow <unk>
So once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then you drive all the media.
That's where you will give the best of the thing.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell you, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity on the <unk> of <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until she passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If we had been alive today, we could not give it to her more help than the one who was <unk> gave it <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, we're going to affect 150 million that, by the way, put many of you.
If you expect to live up to the age 85 or more, the possibility of receiving Alzheimer's will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability that your years is going to spend their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping care for a friend or being dear to Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's percent costs about 200 billion dollars every year.
So one of five dollars of healthcare is spend on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times in 2050, which as the generation of <unk> are <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we have spent less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research, despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs the more disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everyone else <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few <unk> years, all of us, even scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We thought that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But only you have to look at a photo of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know that they're made of molecules of protein.
You can think of a protein molecule, like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> spots are in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
It was <unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that you can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the people have shrunk the cords and waiting for the better.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physicists, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
And the maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick in each other inside them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just an initial result of a positive outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's, we need help.
This is not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have came more and more <unk> and <unk> on governments, drug industry industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
It was an article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience to test it one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you ever put someone else from another person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your couple what you like to do, or it is, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really really struck me -- the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to be able to kill it.
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought that it was a good story, so I send it to the name that we had a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you probably wonder, keep together still yet?
And the reason I believe that this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I put up the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked myself to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and I imagined that my article in the New York Times it would probably be a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and the Saturday, this occurred on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday already had called today's Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with it candor -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship to an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the response.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for Saint <unk> that included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this focus was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I have a television television interviews, and <unk> the orders of pictures of us two.
I think it was afraid of becoming the icons in the <unk> of the <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that the people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to make love <unk> not just an adventure, but a real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just about a few months, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know whether or not, and it will be <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not making romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for encouraging insight into interpersonal students between college students -- using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic -- right?
But I study it worked.
The participants became more close after doing that, several post-conflict studies, they also used to be able to create a very fast way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community, and they used it among people in the opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
I said, "You want to say that you get away from the person who you want to do.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation was <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to see all of my adulthood, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea what or if I could live without him.
So I was in science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that could somehow be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought it was only for the book that I was writing with, but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than to be able to demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut for <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate something about the risk of <unk> and this is a very scary story because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still follow together?
And their content with a reply to Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's think that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are going to be <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known study and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are <unk> we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of the reading now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, there was no thought of what that choice was.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how long I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it enough to have done, and I responded 36 questions, and I would have chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun and <unk> that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of truth.
And what I'm going to do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to see the happy ending of implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really write through.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> and in a way, I was like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time.  One thing that affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar bill and a <unk> and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some kind of weird humanoid robot, and I thought some of the weird humanoid box would find this box about 500 years later, and <unk> how our species, ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
In a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going on a tour and <unk> and all these things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> the style of Agnes Martin, the <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, it happened, the opposite of some way it seemed like it grew up size, as if it was that they were <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did -- I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, and we put very strange bottles of bottles that I could find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow out of it, draw <unk> like a dead <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from it.
First of all, you get to get an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and stuff, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I got to get it.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing of a window on a window and another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that put a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters tall.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with their heads of animals travel between two worlds.
You're going on the world of representation -- this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are heading on <unk> lists for suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there's all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out there.
His hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's an aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail of a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go around you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from terrorist cards.
They have <unk> them.
They were made in the 1980s as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in 20 or 12 or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk in between them.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a single human in its inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, the <unk>
I'm going to run you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There's a little bit of pills that go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
And within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in it strikes each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that is living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweet and <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is going to make effect on your body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the tumor <unk>
But they also are known for their side effects of <unk> because in the time that it takes in the stream to the stream of negative, it <unk> and worse still for the time that it takes to get their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV kitchen.
These are regions of the body like the nodes and the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get into the bloodstream of the patients that will be transferred to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the drugs that are current that is a living treatment for life is <unk>
And one day, I sat down and I thought, "Could you get the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery surgery can be used for anything else -- including transportation <unk>
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes that open and closed holes almost immediately the infected cells with HIV to introduce drug medications.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small beam of laser <unk> on the cellular membrane for HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the heart of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total polio eradication of the body.
Yeah. <unk> cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all investigator of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've looked at armed groups not <unk> and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents from violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the <unk>
I do a field work -- in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of peace agreements, between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor not government.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> at any process of successful conflict.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons why they do it, but nobody really analyzes what they do when they didn't exist.
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party and a network of social services and military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
es multitasking place.
It was a complex machinery of communication stations from radio, TV channels, websites web websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine in English, and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising but by example, <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: create stronger ties with their population to invest in social services.
They build schools, they run schools, they run in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't get security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan divided by war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> you can also see the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, the security has a huge price for the population.
But in general, provide social services that means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral election of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps in the government, and emerge as armed and political and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and governance.
And the more and more sophisticated and sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can see it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was a part of the ground, they run all their function, they collect the garbage, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of <unk> nations and hybrids and the weakest the <unk> are the states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in tools.
<unk> that government gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we understand better groups, we will understand better what incentives to deliver to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give us peace and stability.
So to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safe performance to fill that safe gap that allowed these groups to flourish in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views of gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that we accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I would love me as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> the sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> that could be feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word taboo and nasty.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who calls too much, with high self-worth and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and it can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were doing the same times for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as <unk> or violence.
We have right to use very easy and accessible the contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need of checks or doctrines or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to see our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and the <unk> social condition and <unk>
We need to be aware of these differences and how we care about the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap music -- rap at all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and lies deeply, the classic <unk> classic <unk> the yin and yang -- is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get away the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my musical speech.
I believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of trash, the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion journals.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies about the fairy tales, which they do.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I am not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes more vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> corresponding feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the gay workers and <unk> for white, white, white women, high and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist guy.
It also happens the question: <unk> a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to be able to make it happen.
When we get <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider me to <unk> that <unk> before I try to put in there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> by fear of what that means is for fear that it would not be able to accomplish with a little bit of realistic expectations.
Take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
Over the last few years is a feminist feminist <unk>
The <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> looking at this star of the pop star embracing Feminism and to know the women and the young men that will be feminist is something to be proud to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started <unk> if <unk> was not a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We have a lot of the <unk> because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond a sensible criticism of the <unk> and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman -- <unk> until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad encounter or more good, a more inclusive point is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more brave.
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy giving a supply supply.
And these artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they can make change affecting actually their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad choices justify this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and very brave. I want to grow in a world.
And where they are being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think about them, all of a sudden, the best choice is <unk> like something much more easy to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as a sports program, and the game <unk>
We can change the radio station when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when the movies are not dealing with women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't involve a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also engage ourselves in this kind of projects, and we can also engage them as far as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the jobs.
Because we are not a <unk> <unk> not to adopt these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little action acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power and producers of film and music, and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim the bravery of this, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> me and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys were told when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe me, I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was struck by a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
And by writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little brave one, another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is all about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the awkward reality that I'm just a woman.
I am a <unk> psychiatrists, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need to be a little bit of <unk>
Just after Christmas last year -- <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal to a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most easily likely diseases of the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this from more than half a century -- but a lot of the children involved in the outbreak -- they didn't have been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism, and the <unk> vaccines industry, and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the vaccine theory cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger of their children from having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it to make all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence remained stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
And the hedge fundraising group as <unk> <unk> are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic as if I could give it another child in <unk>
What's going on here?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control what's going on, what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to have less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how the autism was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake and the consequences of the same are having an impact on global public health health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands before their faces, but they were prey by panic percent, as when they didn't put their favorite toy in his usual place without knowing it.
On the base of the patients were treated in their clinic, he was <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject -- declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the <unk> criteria for the diagnosis of autism, were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had become nine percent of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept it carefully on a fridge that didn't happen.
At the same time, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that we cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before he turned the two.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents who had heard their parents like to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty <unk>
She and her husband was John and <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like black-eyed wasn't special education, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National National Service, that they needed more resources for autistic kids and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit nice boxes and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did anyone have not noticed these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then they had been buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> at his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he would take it for her.
The document is an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in the clinic started with music exercises with music, and the children followed their games on them at night.
Instead of blaming the parent of causing autism, Asperger's as a <unk> disability of life required <unk> and <unk> spaces in the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients as patients, in the name of their little teachers, and he was going to help the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of bracelets and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always had been, watching aspects of this continuum in architectural culture as the <unk> social scientist and the awkward arts and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism, is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with the autism, as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to broaden the criteria of the diagnostic Association that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> in <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes didn't fell into a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith were working on each other to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
He should no longer have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of consciousness awareness.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it went, making the people with autism, and their families finally get the support and the services that were <unk>
And so Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the <unk> and a very powerful and <unk> history of history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the present estimate of the heart rate of preventing one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is right in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzle for solving new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Indeed, autistic people have hard to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting to <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most electronic aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands of the hands on the cover of the <unk>
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
